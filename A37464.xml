         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>SInce my late Lord <hi>Warrington</hi> your Father truſted me with the care of your Education, your Lordſhip has made ſo great a Progreſs in all things which I Taught you, that I am now forced to procure you another Tutor: You are become in a little time a great Maſter of ſeveral Languages, and moſt parts of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, and I may ſay without flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb facs="tcp:58538:4"/>that your Lordſhip hath Genius, Learning and Piety enough to make one of the Beſt and the moſt Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh't Gentleman in <hi>England:</hi> But yet your Quality requires ſomething more; for it is not enough for one in your Lordſhips High Station to be Humaniſt, Geographer, Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, (and I may add) a good Man too; he muſt be alſo a States-man, and a Politician; but being neither, my ſelf I muſt repeat the ſame thing over again to my Shame, and to your Credit, that your Lordſhip wants a better Maſter. Amongſt ſeveral of the moſt Eminent Men which I could recommend to your Lordſhip, I found none ſo Learned, nor indeed ſo fit to make deep Impreſſions upon your Mind as your Lordſhips Noble Father, whoſe Writings belongs to you as well as his Eſtate; I don't doubt but you will ſtrive to get the
<pb facs="tcp:58538:4"/>beſt ſhare of his Learning; nor can you fail of an Extream Delight by drawing Sciences but of the ſame Spring from whence your Noble Blood did flow. His Book then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yours both by Inheritance, and by the particular gift of its Authour, it would be unjuſt to preſent it to any other but your Lordſhip; and needleſs to recommend it, or beg your acceptance for't: Therefore omitting any longer Preface, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation of theſe <hi>Golden Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,</hi> I'll only take leave to make this Obſervation upon them, That as there is nothing wanting in them for your Lordſhip's Inſtruction both by Humane Learning and Solid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, I have fitted you with the Maſter that I look't for, and whom you wanted: From whom having obtained all the Qualifications which your Noble Soul is capable of;
<pb facs="tcp:58538:5"/>you have no more to wiſh for, but that you may live and practice 'em; and it will be to me both a great Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and Honour to ſee my Work finiſht by the ſame Artiſt who put it firſt into my hands, and truſted me with the beginning of it. It will be enough for me that I have put my hands to ſuch a Maſter-piece, and ſhall be highly honoured if your Lordſhip take notice of my Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and ſufficiently Rewarded if you grant your Protection to him who has no other Ambition than to be,</p>

            <p>HAving lived in an Age, where a few Months has produced great Revolutions and Troubles, the miſchievous effects of which having fallen very heavy as well upon my own Perſon, as upon my Family: For before I was nine years old I ſaw my Father a cloſe Priſoner in the <hi>Tower</hi> ſeven Months for his Loyalty to his King and Country, and by little leſs than Miracle thence delivered; and having but juſt paſſed over my Thirty Fourth Year, for the next day (after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been a cloſe Priſoner in the <hi>Tower</hi> three times) I was tryed for my Life, for adhering to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of my Country. And now in my Thirty Seventh Year perceiving a boiſterous Storm to approach, by which I may probably expect to be ſwept away in the common Calamity, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58538:10"/>muſt leave you all very Young; I think it to be the beſt thing I can do for you, to advertiſe you of the rocks and precipices which by means of my Troubles and Sufferings I have diſcovered: And to that end it is that I recommend to you the following diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Next to being wiſe to Salvation, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that more concerns any man, than to know how to order his Affairs with diſcretion: For this not only brings us with eaſe and content through the world; but this double Happineſs alſo attends it, Firſt by it we leave behind us that highly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable thing of a good Name, and Secondly it helps us many ſteps in our way to Heaven. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to give you ſome directions how to ſteer your courſe through this World is the occaſion of the following diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, be ſure to begin and end the day with God. Let not any buſineſs prevent you from ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſome time in private devotion both Morning and Evening: For this, as without contradiction it is our duty, ſo Reaſon does ſtrongly perſwade the practice of it: For if we do believe that there is a God, and that all our hairs are numbred, which implies his particular care of us; can we expect that he ſhould take us the reſt of the day into his protection, when we ſet ſo little by it, as not to think it worth the asking? Were any of us to go ſome road which we had never travelled before, and beſides ſo full of holes and precipices, and ſuch as whileſt we avoided one, it would be great odds that we fell into another, and conſequently would be extreamly bruiſed if not-killed, and there is but one Perſon who knew the way; would not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58538:10"/>we be very importunate with him to guide us? If then we do but ſeriouſly conſider the multitude of hazards and dangers which we are expoſed to in one day, we muſt conclude that our preſervation is purchaſed by a very ſmall price, even by a few minutes in private devotion in the Morning. And there is as great reaſon for our evening Sacrifice. It is a very ſmall favour that does not deſerve thanks; but great ought our acknowledgments to be every evening for our preſervation the day paſt: For reckon up by how many ſeveral accidents men have dyed, even ſo many and more do we eſcape every day; and then conſider how ſmall a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence we render to the Lord for ſuch tranſcendent Benefits, and how gracious he is to accept ſo ſmall a tribute as we are able to pay him in a quarter or half an hour in private. Conſider further, if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt man and man an acknowledgment of a favour received lays a ſort of obligation upon the Perſon to beſtow a ſecond; what may we not expect from God, whoſe goodneſs extends beyond what we can comprehend? for he beſtows Benefits upon the moſt ungrateful; and then we may be ſure that a ſincere and humble tribute of thanks will be very acceptable to him. And that it may be ſuch, take eſpecial care, that your Supplications (as much as in you lies) be void of all diſtraction and dullneſs, leſt being performed careleſly and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally you may ſeem to mock God: for he cannot be pleaſed with ſuch Services, neither will he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them in mercy: For I have obſerved, any Morning that I have <hi>hurried</hi> over my Devotions, the day following has not been proſperous, and that thing which particularly occaſioned me to ſuch haſte, has met with ill ſucceſs.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:58538:11"/>
            <p>In the next place, Let all your Dealings be meaſured by the <hi>golden Rule,</hi> of doing to others as you would be done by. For as without this you cannot be a good Chriſtian, ſo he that is void of it cannot be a truly moral man. It is much to be lamented, that amongſt us it is not more ſeriouſly conſidered, and faithfully practiſed: For the want of it is the root, from whence moſt of our miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs and troubles do ſpring. And whenever men do entertain a juſt opinion of it, then will the World be truly ſaid to enjoy the golden Age: For next to the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, nothing can procure ſo much peace on Earth. True it is, that ſeeming Advantages may frequently offer themſelves to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us to go beſide this Rule; but indeed they have only an out-ſide, and no more: for what a man gains thereby, is but of a ſhort duration, and ſeldom ends but in trouble and vexation; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of Gods way, it cannot be expected that his Bleſſing ſhould attend it, and without that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can proſper. And beſides, he that in a great meaſure does not practice this Rule, cannot go out of the World with the name of an honeſt man; and he that is not ſolicitous to leave behind him that character, is fitter to herd with Brutes, than to be admitted into any civil Society.</p>
            <p>And now let me recommend to you the Duty and Affection which you owe to your <hi>Country:</hi> For next to God's Glory, there is nothing that ought to be ſo dear to you as the <hi>common good;</hi> it is to be preferred to your Life, Eſtate or Family. To this you are ſtrongly perſwaded as Man is a ſociable Creature, for it is by the mutual aſſiſtance of each other that Mankind ſubſiſts. Let every Man ſeek only himſelf, and have no regard to the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58538:11"/>common good, nothing but an univerſal diſorder and confuſion would thereupon enſue; and then what profit can we expect of all the labour that Man takes under the Sun? True it is, that fiſhing in troubled Waters may be a gainful to ſome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; yet all their attempts are done in expectation that there will be a ſettlement in the Publick, as without which their Undertakings will prove ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual; So that not only Nature, but Self-Intereſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue irrefragably for it. Beſides, as we owe the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of our Age to the care that our Fore-fathers had of the Publick; ſo it lays a duty upon us to tranſmit to Poſterity what was bequeathed to us: No man is more ignoble, than he who throws off all thought for the Publick, the very Heathens could ſay, how pleaſant and delightful is it to dye for their Countrey? It is by reaſon of this concern for the Publick that we render ſuch honour to the King; who if the Common-wealth did not receive great Advantage by his Care and due adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Juſtice, would be regarded no more than another man. There never yet was any good Man who had not an ardent zeal for his Countrey; And to all men of true honour and worth, it is a more pleaſant reflection to think how uſeful they have been in their Generation, than how wealthy they are grown.</p>
            <p>Though we are bound to do all the good we can, yet you ought not to be over-forward in taking upon you any publick Imployment, ſave with theſe two Cautions, Firſt, that you be in ſome good meaſure qualified for it. Secondly, that you undertake it for the ſake of Gods Glory and the good of your Country, and not to gratifie your Ambition: For as by reaſon of Inſufficiency, you
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58538:12"/>will certainly come off with ſhame; ſo by deſiring it for a wrong end, God will not proſper it. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the <hi>activeneſs</hi> of your temper may puſh you on to buſineſs; in that caſe you have no more to do but to make your ſelf fit for it; and then a man of your quality and condition need not hunt after imployment, for it will ſeek him out.</p>
            <p>Now as good eſteem and popular applauſe are the general returns to good ſervice done for the publick, ſo ſuch as deſerve it, ſeldom fail of it: And you will find that this Nation is more ſteady in the firſt and the more valuable, I mean their good eſteem and affection, than in the latter, for that is beſtowed upon every occaſion, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing become common is of leſs value. If then you have done your Countrey good ſervice, be not diſturbed when you may think the merits of your ſervice is forgotten and drowned in the applauſes that are given to ſome popular action: For you will often ſee that though a Man has been the greateſt Villain to his Country, yet upon doing any one popular thing, he ſhall for the preſent be cryed up as the beſt and <hi>braveſt</hi> man alive; but as this has no foundation, ſo it will prove but a nine days wonder, and when that time is expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they will return to their Wits, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thoſe to whom they are obliged. When you are got into imployment, be it never ſo agreeable to you, let not the fear of being turned out prevail with you to do the leaſt Injuſtice, or to act irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, neither for the ſerving of a turn, nor for any other Conſideration: For upright behaviour in regular times, is the ſureſt way to keep you in your Seat: And in times of diſorder you muſt reſolve to do every ill thing that is put upon you,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58538:12"/>if by ſuch means you will keep your place, for the doing of one will not ſecure you. Now though you loſe your Place by refuſing to do what you think is not juſt, yet you retain your Honour and Conſcience, and all the odium your Enemies would caſt upon you will then prove only malitious aſperſions, and turn with ſhame upon the head of your Accuſers: And by your Integrity you will give your Family ſo great a Reputation, as ſooner or later will turn more to the advantage of it, than the holding of your Place longer could have been.</p>
            <p>When you are in a very <hi>high Station,</hi> be ſure to behave your ſelf with the like familiarity to all ſorts of Perſons, as you did before your promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For by this you will not only gain the eſteem of every body; But if you are diſplaced, you will loſe nothing of the reſpect that was paid you.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, be ſure to be <hi>eaſie of acceſs</hi> to every one that has buſineſs with you, and give them all the diſpatch you can: For as in common charity you are bound to do it, that no man may be tyred out in attending his juſt concerns, ſo it is an honeſt policy to keep friends in ſtore againſt an evil time; whereas they who practice the contrary, not only procure themſelves hatred whileſt they are in Place, but when turned out (for ſuch don't ſtand long) none are ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed and contemned as they.</p>
            <p>But an Imployment at Court, I mean ſuch as is purely within the Court abſtracted from the Publick, is ſeriouſly to be thought on before you ingage in it: For nothing but the pure profit can incline a man of a generous and noble Spirit to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58538:13"/>accept of it. For though Princes ſhould be exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Piety as well as adminiſters of Juſtice; yet there is ſo much looſeneſs and diſorder in their Families, that a man who lives there muſt be very well fortified with Religion and Morality, or he will be in great danger of loſing his Integrity: For how often will he be neceſſitated to neglect his Devotion both in publick and private, and at beſt hand poſtpone the worſhipping of God to the attendance on his Prince, and ſerve God only in the ſecond place: And then it is no ſtrange thing if the miſt occaſion'd by the arbitrary vapours of the Court do ſo far miſlead him as to fall down and worſhip him who is but his fellow-creature; yet great reſpect is due to him, becauſe placed in ſome degrees above him for his good and advantage.</p>
            <p>Conſider beſides the ſervile compliances to which he muſt ſubmit, even to pretend to love the man he hates, and crouch and bend to the man that he does deſpiſe; And as Courts are always in Factions and Parties, ſo he cannot avoid falling in with ſome ſide; and whatever they drive at, he muſt implicitely purſue it, though to the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſome Perſon who never injured him, or any other thing as baſe as that.</p>
            <p>Add to this, how unſetled he muſt be, always in a hurry, and ſhifting from place to place at an hours warning, and pay ſuch ſlaviſh attendance as we don't expect from the meaneſt of our Servants: And in the mean while his Eſtate in the Country is left to the honeſty of Servants, in which as he cannot fail to be a loſer, ſo muſt he alſo in the intereſt and affection of his Neighbours: Whereas he that lives at his own houſe, has daily opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of doing good, and is ſtill gaining upon the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58538:13"/>good will and eſteem of his Countrey, ſo that when any of them ſee him, they do not fail to pay him reſpect, and at the ſame time wiſh him well from their heart.</p>
            <p>Though this is not intended as a diſcourſe upon the <hi>Politicks,</hi> but as ſome directions in your paſſage through this World; yet I conceive it not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to ſay ſomething of <hi>Government</hi> in general, and therein of a King, ſince the want of a right notion herein has been the occaſion that many a one of honeſt intentions has gone out of the World with the character of an ill Man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Government</hi> then in general is neceſſary, as well becauſe of Gods expreſs Command, as alſo that no Society of men can ſubſiſt without it: And that particular form of Government is neceſſary, which beſt ſuits the temper and inclination of the People, and thereby becomes to be Gods Ordinance; But no particular model of Government is ſuch in it ſelf, ſave ſo far as it effects the true end of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For nothing can be God's Ordinance, but what he has expreſly declared to be ſuch. And if he had thought any ſort of Government to have been better, or more neceſſary than another, he would not have left the World ſo much in the dark in a matter of ſo high importance; but he would either have expreſly declared it in his Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word, or diſcovered it to us by the inſtinct of Nature; But we cannot find any ſuch thing in Holy Writ, neither does Nature prompt it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are ſo many ſeveral ſorts of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the World, no two of them agreeing in every point, but differing in ſomething that is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry material. And even the Jews, Gods peculiar People, who received their Statutes and Judgments
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58538:14"/>immediately from him, yet therein he did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe or limit them to any particular form; but what he did command were only rules in general for the executing of Judgment and Juſtice amongſt themſelves; for we find that the form of their Government was changed no leſs than five times, If not more often: 1. Under Patriarchs, 2 Under <hi>Moſes,</hi> 3. Under Judges, 4. Under the High Prieſt, 5. Under Kings. So that nothing can be more clear, than that God has not appointed the World any form of Government, but left every Nation and People to chuſe ſuch a Model as beſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked them: And I have often thought, that God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty did on purpoſe permit the Jewiſh conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution to be changed ſo often, to let the World underſtand that every form of Government was alike indifferent to him, and that if any People found theirs to be out of order, the blame reſted at their doors if it was not reformed.</p>
            <p>The true original of Government being thus diſcovered, it gives us plainly to underſtand whence Kings receive their Power, and what is the natural and lawful meaſure of their power: For if God Almighty did permit every people to model their own Government, from whence can the Kings Prerogative flow, ſave out of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution? Unleſs it be ſuppoſed, which is ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to imagine, that Kings are ſent down imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from Heaven with their Commiſſion in their hands, or elſe that they <hi>begat all their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</hi> If then their power does flow from the Conſtitution, the natural extent of it does ſeem to be limited within the rules of doing equal right to rich and poor, to relieve the oppreſſed, and to puniſh the guilty, unleſs it can be ſuppoſed that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58538:14"/>cruelty and oppreſſion is more eligible than Juſtice and Peace. And therefore it is more than to be ſuppoſed, that when any People conferred ſo great a truſt upon their King, it was with this condition, either expreſſed or implied, that as much as in him lay he ſhould lay out that power to the good and advantage of the People: For though ſeveral Kings have taken upon them to govern by their Will, and this practice has prevailed for many Succeſſions and Ages, yet this cannot give them a good title to their arbitrary Rule, becauſe the body of the People have an earlier claim, and a younger title muſt give place to the elder, and a title or power gained either by force or fraud can never be good, and by one of theſe two arbitrary Power can only be gained: For the meaſure of Power, which by the inſtitution of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was aſſigned to the King, cannot in reaſon be ſuppoſed to be any other, than ſuch as men of ſound underſtandings and without conſtraint ſhould judge to be moſt behoveful to the common good. Now if Kings may of right exerciſe a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer beyond this, then is the condition of every Subject much worſe than the Brutes; for Brutes, though chaced from their uſual abode, yet can they in any other place find food and lodging, as well as where they uſed to frequent; and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are killed or purſued, it is becauſe they are hurtful, or that the ſeiſing of them is uſeful to men: But when Subjects, by reaſon of the cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and oppreſſion of an arbitrary King, are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated to fly for their Lives, they are under a certainty of periſhing for want of food and lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if not relieved by the charity of others; and their deſtruction is reſolved on, not that they
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58538:15"/>have offended againſt the Laws of nature or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but becauſe the intentions and thoughts of their King are evil. A King that lays out himſelf for the good of his people, is to be obeyed for Conſcience ſake, for he is God's Ordinance; and ſuch a King can never be too highly eſteemed, nor the loſs of him ſufficiently lamented. But when a King forſakes the guidance of the Law, and rules only by his Will, to call ſuch an one God's Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is very abſurd, unleſs we can ſuppoſe God to be the Authour of confuſion and oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>All that have written of <hi>Government</hi> agree in this, that Kings were created or ſet up that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice may be had, which does plainly intimate theſe things, Firſt, That every King is ſuch by reaſon of the conſtitution of the Government. 2. That he is admitted to that truſt upon condition. 3. That when he does not adminiſter Juſtice, much more when he oppreſſes the People, he exceeds the limits of his lawful power; and both this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Expoſition is not denyed by any, ſave ſome ignorant <hi>Ambitious Clergy,</hi> who in hopes of preferment have turned <hi>Bawds to Arbitrary Power.</hi> And the Coronation Oath, or Solemn Ingagement which every King takes before he is crowned, confirms the foregoing Obſervations; and what can oblige the taking of that Oath, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Government? For ſince Mankind is ſo greedy of Power, and prone to incroach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on anothers right, can it be ſuppoſed that Kings would clog themſelves with the <hi>Coronation Oath,</hi> if they could avoid it, much leſs that they would on their own accord ſo ſhackle themſelves?</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:58538:15"/>
            <p>What has been ſaid, will ſerve to explain what is the true meaning of a natural Prince or Lord, a notion, which for want of conſideration, has gulled a great many good People, and yet amounts to no more than this, That he is one of our Brethren, or born amongſt us.</p>
            <p>It is a <hi>meer conceit,</hi> to imagine that any thing is ſuch by the inſtitution of Nature: For if Nature had formed any Government, every other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the World would have been of the ſame Form and Model to all intents and purpoſes: For Nature is immutable and the ſame in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and what it does in one place, it does the ſame thing in another. So that all that Nature does in the framing of any Government, is only to concur with the people in making choice of that which beſt ſuits their diſpoſition and temper, not to preſcribe or neceſſitate them to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular form: And then conſequently it will follow, that what lawful Right or Power every King claims, is by reaſon of the conſtitution of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and not from Nature.</p>
            <p>If there be any ſuch thing as this Natural Right, it muſt be inherent in all lawful Kings; for if ſome of them have it, why not all of them? And if any have, every King elſe has the ſame. And if this be ſo, where was the Natural Right of King <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> II, both born out of the Realm, their Fathers Forraigners, and at the ſame time there were others, who by right of deſcent were nearer to the Crown than either of them.</p>
            <p>It was not this natural right that invented the coronation oath, neither is it by reaſon of it that every King of <hi>England</hi> is bound to take it before
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58538:16"/>they can require any of their Subjects to do them homage and fealty.</p>
            <p>If there be any ſuch thing as this natural right, then it will follow that all the Kings of the earth but one are Uſurpers; becauſe this natural right muſt ariſe from <hi>Primogeniture;</hi> and there can be but one man at the ſame time who is the rightful Heir and Succeſſor to <hi>Adam;</hi> and conſequently all others that pretend to be Kings, uſurp upon his right. So that this notion of a natural right, pulls down the thing it pretends to ſet up.</p>
            <p>When a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> is changed into a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, is it this natural right that makes him King who is firſt ſet up? Or when a Family is extinct that has been long in poſſeſſion of the Crown, and the Body of the People chuſe a King from amongſt themſelves, is it by this natural right that he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to this dignity? But as a multitude of other abſurdities would follow upon it, ſo the Apoſtle puts the thing out of diſpute, when he ſays, That Kings are the Ordinance of man. And here I will leave Kings to reſolve which is their beſt title, whether this natural right, or the conſtitution of the Government.</p>
            <p>Differences and diſputes do but too frequently ariſe betwixt the King and People; and therefore I will tell you what I conceive to be adviſable when ſuch ill humours are afloat.</p>
            <p>Conſider whoſe demands do beſt ſuit the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good; For by a ſerious and impartial exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of that you will be able to diſcover who is in the right: For if you follow this rule exactly, it will not miſguide you. And take this Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion along with you, When the State is diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, you will find for the moſt part (if not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways)
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58538:16"/>that the cauſe of offence proceeds from the Court. And the reaſon of it is very evident, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſo long as <hi>Engliſh men</hi> injoy their rights, they have no occaſion to quarrel with the King, for they need nothing elſe. But Kings as they are, always think they are too ſhort in power, and thoſe that are about them are too apt to incourage thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires in Kings; becauſe the more abſolute he is, the more able he is to gratifie his Creatures. Now in this caſe, let not the opinion of the <hi>Clergy</hi> govern you; for none are <hi>blinder Guides</hi> than they, and no one thing hath done more miſchief in this Nation than their politicks.</p>
            <p>If you happen to be on the prevailing ſide, uſe your advantage with <hi>Moderation.</hi> This you are obliged to do as you are a good Chriſtian, and <hi>ſelf-intereſt</hi> pleads for it: for ſince the events of all things are uncertain, there may come another turn, and then in reaſon you may expect fair quarter from them, whom you treated ſo well in the day of your power.</p>
            <p>If your Party come by the worſt, remember theſe two things; Firſt, don't think the worſe of your Cauſe by reaſon of the Succeſs; Neither make any <hi>mean ſubmiſſion,</hi> nor do any other ſordid thing to get out of your trouble; uſe only lawful and honeſt means, for if you are in the right, ſooner or later it will prevail, and then in the end you will come off with double honour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If you are examined as a <hi>criminal,</hi> confeſs nothing, only argue againſt the inſufficiency of what is objected againſt you. For Firſt, It is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your courage and reſolution. Secondly, By confeſſing any thing, you help them to evidence againſt your ſelf and others; for you furniſh them
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58538:17"/>with <hi>time</hi> and <hi>place,</hi> and then it is an eaſie matter for a Knight of the Poſt to give ſuch an evidence againſt you as is not eaſily diſproved. Thirdly, It's very ſeldom that you will meet with better uſage, though you confeſs never ſo much, unleſs you will turn accuſer of others, and give evidence againſt them; which is ſo baſe a thing, that I would adviſe you to undergoe any extremity rather than do that: For as your own Party will for ever abhor you and your Memory, ſo the other ſide will deſpiſe and ſlight you as ſoon as you have done their buſineſs, and all that you can do for the future will never wipe off ſuch a blot.</p>
            <p>If you are concerned in the proſecution of any publick Criminal, let your proceedings be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with Juſtice and Moderation: For I have ſeen it fatal to ſeveral who have ſtrained and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Law to the deſtruction of others, yet in the end fell into the Pit they digged for others, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by their own Law.</p>
            <p>When the State is ſo ſore that it makes a Man an Offender for a Word, and the times are ſo evil that the prudent keep ſilence; Then are all mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings to be avoided, ſave only ſuch as are upon real buſineſs, recreation, or for Neighbourly Viſits, and thoſe too in as ſmall numbers as may be, for Spyes and Informers will thruſt themſelves into Conſults and Cabals, and of all others will ſay the hotteſt and moſt violent things, in hopes that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that all proceeds from the fervency of their Zeal, you may thereby be induced to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that will bring you within the compaſs of the Law: Or if you have the diſcretion or good hap to ſay nothing, yet your very being in the ſame Company where ſuch things have been ſaid or
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:58538:17"/>uttered, may either make you criminal, or at beſt hand involve you into a great deal of trouble, without bringing any advantage to the Cauſe you do aſſert. And beſides, he that herds in Cabals, muſt implicitely adhere to the opinion of that Company; for by aſſerting his own Judgment in oppoſition to theirs, though he be never ſo much in the right, he runs the hazard of being reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched for a Spye or Deſerter.</p>
            <p>As you ought not to refuſe any danger, when a proportionable advantage will thereby accrue to the Cauſe you would ſupport; ſo in ſuch ſore times you ought to avoid the doing of any thing unneceſſary, hot and provoking, unleſs where you or the Cauſe will reap benefit thereby. For young men, either through the heat of their years, or the inſtigation of more crafty people, are too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten prevailed upon to do many things, that in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance look very brave, and for the preſent may gain a popular applauſe, but in the end ſerve only to expoſe the Perſons themſelves and the Cauſe they ſtand by: For a hot-headed or raſh Action of any one Man, eſpecially if he be of note, furniſhes the other ſide with ſufficient mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to brand the whole Party with it. if therefore you ſhall at any time be put upon doing any ſuch thing, do but deſire thoſe that propoſe it to lead you the way; and if they refuſe, you may be ſure that it was not your good they intended, but to promote ſome ſelfiſh end of their own, though they fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw that it would expoſe, if not ruine you.</p>
            <p>Theſe Directions, and what elſe can be given you, will not much avail without your own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of them, which muſt be done by reading and obſervation; and thoſe ſorts of Studies
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58538:18"/>ſeem to be moſt eligible by men of generous tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, which tend moſt to fit a man for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Service; and next to God's Law, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more neceſſary for an Engliſh-man than to be well acquainted with the Law of his own Country; to the attaining of it ſeveral Books are to be read, of which I do in particular recommend to you <hi>Coke</hi>'s <hi>Inſtitutes, Croke</hi>'s, <hi>Hubbert</hi>'s, <hi>Dyer</hi>'s and <hi>Vaughan</hi>'s <hi>Reports,</hi> and eſpecially the latter, for though it contains but a few Caſes, yet they contain in them ſuch ſtrong reaſon as gives great Light into other matters. Next to theſe, all my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>'s Works, and a Book called <hi>Bacon</hi>'s Uniformed Government of the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> which is worth its weight in Gold. Next, <hi>Lambert</hi>'s Saxon Laws, <hi>Forteſcue</hi> of the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> A Book Intitled <hi>De Pace Regis &amp; Regni,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther called the <hi>Rights of the Kingdom,</hi> and a ſmall Book Intitled <hi>Nihil dictum, quod non dictum prius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moſt, if not all of theſe you will find in my ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and they may eaſily be read over in a few Months, and time enough allowed for Buſineſs and Recreation. When you have gone through them, I am perſwaded that they will not only give you an appetite to read them over again, and make obſervations as you go along, but alſo to enquire after other Books of that ſort.</p>
            <p>Next to a knowledge in the <hi>Law; Hiſtory</hi> is very neceſſary, and eſpecially of our own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. And though we have many Chronicles, yet the Lives of our Kings that are written by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular hands are the beſt, and give the trueſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of things. It is alſo neceſſary to look into the Hiſtories of other Countreys, and the Lives of Famous Men, as thoſe that paſs under the Title
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58538:18"/>of <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s <hi>Lives, Grotius de jure belli &amp; pacis</hi> is allowed by all to be one of the beſt Books that ever was writ. And notwithſtanding the clamour that is made againſt <hi>Machiavil,</hi> I would not have you to paſs him by; for that part of him againſt which the out-cry is made, it is only Inſtructions what a Tyrant is to do if he will reign ſafely; yet he does not perſwade any King to it, but is much againſt it, as you will ſee in reading over his Works.</p>
            <p>To read a <hi>Play</hi> or <hi>Romance</hi> now and then for diverſion, may do no hurt; but he that ſpends moſt of his time in ſuch Books, will be able to give a very ill account of it.</p>
            <p>Be your Studies what they will, yet be ſure to drive the nail only as you find it will go. That is, in the firſt place, never go to your Study but when you find your ſelf very well diſpoſed to it; for to do otherwiſe, is to go againſt the grain, and nothing that way can be well done. In the ſecond place, ſtay no longer at it than you can taſte what you read; for after that your thoughts begin to be unſteady or wander, it is loſs of time to proſecute it: nay it will occaſion you to loſe much of what you had gained before, and ſo you will go backwards inſtead of forwards: For nothing is more miſchievous in ſtudying, than to tye ones ſelf to a certain time of going to it, or ſtaying ſo long, or reading ſo much together, for we are not at all times alike diſpoſed to our Book. Now by ſtudying only when we are diſpoſed, though we do not ſeem to make ſuch haſte, yet we make better ſpeed; for a Book read over once this way, is of more advantage than thrice read over, if theſe precautions are not obſerved.</p>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:58538:19"/>
            <p>When you are to debate in <hi>Parliament,</hi> or upon any other publick occaſion, and ſince the end of ſpeaking is to convince, Obſerve theſe two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Directions.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Argue as directly and cloſely to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as you can; for this is the ſureſt way to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, becauſe it gives your Opponents the leſs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage againſt what you ſay. And beſides, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is a greater argument of a ſound judgment, than to be able to bring the matter to a point.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Be not over ſollicitous for words and Phraſes, when either they hinder you from digeſting your matter throughly, or occaſion you to ſay any thing that has not ſome weight in it. Apt words and quaint Phraſes are very good adornments of Speech, yet they are not ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as that for want of them a Man of good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding ought to be ſilent. For deep and weighty Notions, though delivered in a very rough ſtile, will touch the reaſon, and convince the underſtanding, many degrees beyond light and frothy thoughts, though dreſt up in the beſt Language imaginable: For Senſe is beyond words, as much as the Subſtance exceeds the ſhadow. And certain it is, that you will in ſpeaking gain applauſe by good Senſe, rather than by the fineſt Words and Phraſes. It's Senſe that pleaſes the Wiſe and Men of Judgment, and Words and Phraſes without Senſe Tickle the Ears of inſipid people.</p>
            <p>In <hi>private Converſation</hi> remember theſe things. Be the diſcourſe merry or ſerious, let what you ſay be rather good, and to the purpoſe, than much: For he that talks a great deal, does rather expoſe himſelf, than divert or oblige the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58538:19"/>A Man is ſeldom accounted a Fool for ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king too little, but is too often ſo eſteemed for ſpeaking too much, becauſe in the multitude of words there will not want folly.</p>
            <p>In the next place, let neither your behaviour or diſcourſe be formal or ſtarcht, for a tincture of that in either takes off the pleaſure which the World does generally propoſe and expect in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation: For as this does at firſt proceed from affectation, ſo it will always appear to be ſuch, and any thing that is forced or conſtrained in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany is never welcome. He that affects an <hi>over grave</hi> behaviour, or ſet way of ſpeaking, does it rather to admire himſelf, than to pleaſe others; and whatever ſatisfaction they may take in it themſelves, yet it tends to no other end than to render them ridiculous to every Company they come into.</p>
            <p>Promote the Diſcourſe you find is moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Company, if it be not againſt your Opinion; but ſay not any thing that may ſavour either of Fear or Flattery: For he that does ſo, muſt at one time or other ſay contrary things, which is very mean and contemptible; yet ſay not any thing that unneceſſarily may diſoblige any of the Company, unleſs you ſeek for an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to affront that perſon. If any thing be ſaid that diſobliges you, and the affront be ſuch that for the preſent you cannot command your ſelf, withdraw and diſpute it in another place; for by this you will ſhew more breeding and courage, than if you gave the Company more diſturbance about it.</p>
            <p>As you ought not to be over-reſerved to any, ſo you muſt not behave your ſelf alike to every
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58538:20"/>Company; but accordingly as you eſteem or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue any, ſo ſhould you be more eaſie or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
            <p>Though we ought to have fervent Charity, yet it does not forbid us to look warily about us: And therefore be not too haſty in believing that this or that is an honeſt Man: For as for one bad action you ought not to conclude that man to be a Knave, ſo for doing two or three good things, without other evidence or proof, you ought not too confidently to depend upon his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity. And in all Treaties and bargaining, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of moment, believe you have to do with a Knave: For every Man pretends to be honeſt, though few are ſuch. Now as no honeſt Man will blame you for your cautious proceedings, ſo you ſecure your ſelf againſt the advantage that Knaves would make by your lying at a more open Guard.</p>
            <p>Let not any thing of <hi>Pride</hi> appear in you, either towards your Equals or Inferiours. A little Pride looſes a Man a great deal of eſteem: For nothing is more deſpiſed by every body than a proud Man, and no body values him but himſelf; and what he aims at by his haughty and ſtately behaviour he thereby loſes, that is, reſpect: Whereas an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble friendly deportment wins ſtrangely upon all ſorts of people; the <hi>pulling off your Hatt</hi> may ſometimes gain you the heart of that Perſon you took notice of. And though you reap no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by it, yet what great pains is it to move your hand to your Hat. And remember, that the moſt poor and miſerable object is your fellow Creature, only you are placed a degree or two higher than he; yet if God had ſeen it good, you
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:58538:20"/>and that ſad object might have changed places. So that hence ariſes great occaſion of thankfulneſs to God, but not the leaſt of Pride.</p>
            <p>Do not too eaſily credit any thing that is told you to the diſadvantage of another, eſpecially where you are to cenſure or judge it, or your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief may do him prejudice: For as it is a tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that equal Law of doing as you would be done by; ſo it is manifeſtly unjuſt, becauſe you judge that Perſon without hearing him. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, when a man is prepoſſeſt, he will have much adoe to judge righteouſly; for if a gift does blind the Eyes, much more will prepoſſeſſion or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice lead us aſide in judgment. Nature has given us two Ears, which is a plain intimation that we muſt hear both ſides together, and at the ſame time; for no man can judge rightly, if he don't hear both ſides together, and come to hear the cauſe without prejudice or preingagement.</p>
            <p>He that ſpeaks ill of another behind his back, does it either becauſe he has no good will to that Perſon, or becauſe he ſuppoſes that you have not, therefore neither he nor his Errand ſhould be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to you: For as we ought not to ſpeak ill either of the dead or abſent, ſo neither ought we to take pleaſure in hearing that which is to the diſadvantage of either.</p>
            <p>Tale-bearers are a Weed that grow in every Soil, and where they meet with the leaſt incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, draw all the nouriſhment to themſelves, and ſtarve all about them. If you love your quiet, give them no ſort of countenance; for they are a Diſeaſe, that having laid hold of any Perſon, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver leaves him till it has neither left him at peace with any one, nor even himſelf.</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:58538:21"/>
            <p>In the private Affairs of your Family, be ſure that your Expences be leſs rather, than that they do exceed your income; for there are unforeſeen accidents that will find you occaſion enough for all that you can conveniently and with decency ſpare or lay up. If after ſome time of tryal you find that your Eſtate will bear more, you may mend your rate of living, when you cannot abate: For as you will find it very difficult to come down in your way of living, ſo you can ſcarcely avoid reproach in doing it. Some indeed may be of opinion, that they ought to be govern'd in the rule of their living by what others do of their Eſtate and Quality, and not by what they have, although thoſe they would imitate do out-live their Fortunes: But as every Man knows his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition better than the World can, ſo it is much more prudent and commendable for a Man to cut his Coat according to his Cloath, than to follow another that is out of the way, or to keep pace with a Man that is out of his Wits: And he that out-lives his Fortune becauſe another man does ſo, will find that the World will rather laugh him to ſcorn for his folly, than require any ſuch thing at his hands.</p>
            <p>He that prodigally ſpends his Eſtate, will have many to help him forward, and but few that will commend him for it; and when it is gone, will have many to deſpiſe and contemn him, and but few that will pity or relieve him: And as Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancy is an Errour on the one hand, ſo is being Niggardly on the other. When a Man has not a heart in ſome meaſure to enjoy what he poſſeſſes, his abundance becomes a curſe to him, and Riches are given him to his hurt. And no Man is ſo poor,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:58538:21"/>as he that dares not uſe ſome proportion of what he has, and all this ſcraping is only to lay up for ſome Spendthrift; for uſually the next that comes throws it away as faſt as the other got it. And I can ſcarcely determine, whether it is a higher point of diſcretion for a Man rightly to proportion and meaſure his Expences, or elſe of folly extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagantly to ſquander away his Fortune.</p>
            <p>Good <hi>Houſe-keeping</hi> is a thing that is highly praiſe-worthy, and the way to have yours ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed, is to let your proviſions conſiſt rather in ſufficiency of that which is wholſome, than in little curiouſly dreſs'd diſhes, which won't ſuffice to fill your Servants bellies when you have done, and conſequently the poor muſt be ſent railing and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from your gates; for beſide the pleaſing your own appetite, all that you can propoſe to your ſelf by it, is to have an impudent reſort, and the hollow hearted complements of thoſe who by nice feeding have ſo depraved their appetites that they cannot reliſh any thing that has its natural taſte.</p>
            <p>To have your meat well dreſt does well, for there is not much difference betwixt a wilful ſtroy, and to have a great deal of meat ſpoiled in the dreſſing: And therefore let not the want of a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Cook give occaſion to have the proverb re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, that <hi>God ſends meat and the Devil Cooks.</hi> To pinch your Servants bellies to make entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is a piece of <hi>grinning</hi> honour; whether it be a Servant or Beaſt, if their food be ſcanty, they will labour accordingly: And without queſtion a Maſter is as much obliged to give his Servants their meat, and ſufficient of it in due ſeaſon, as the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant is to do his Maſter good and faithful ſervice. If the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were obliged to leave the gleanings
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:58538:22"/>of their fields for the poor and ſtrangers, there lyes no leſs obligation upon us, according to our abilities, to make ſuch proviſion that the poor may not be ſent empty away from our doors. Now as the reproach of it will deter you from being cloſe handed with your meat and drink, ſo what you will be the better at the years end will give no great encouragement to ſuch ſort of frugality: for when the reckoning comes to be caſt up, there will be found very little difference betwixt a niggardly and competent way; for when Servants are pincht, they will be filching, and making all the ſtroy they can; and where they have ſufficient, they will ſave what they can, and prevent your loſs by others as much as in them lyes.</p>
            <p>Let not your Servants be over-familiar or haile fellow with you, neither keep them at too great a diſtance from you: for by allowing them too much familiarity they will quickly deſpiſe and neglect you, and conſequently grow ſawcy and careleſs, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that you are more obliged to them, than they are to you; they will expoſe you wherever you are, and at laſt be fit neither to ſerve you nor any one elſe. And on the other ſide, by keeping too ſtrict and aweful a hand over them, will produce no leſs ill effects: for it does ſo diſcourage them, that it altogether chills that reſpect and affection that a Servant uſually bears to his Maſter; and then all their duty will be turned into eye-ſervice, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no other care, than how to get their work done at any rate, being not further concerned what becomes of it, or whether their Maſter and his affairs do ſink or ſwim; and if it lye in their way, will be as equally inclined to do him an ill as a good turn.</p>
            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:58538:22"/>
            <p>Now by going the middle way, the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of both extreams are avoided. For by looking upon your Servants with a pleaſant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and ſpeaking kindly, and ſometimes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly to them, and living with them eaſily and freely, you incourage them in their Duty, and gain upon their affection and eſteem, and make them as diligent and careful in your buſineſs, as if it were their own, and be as well pleaſed when it is well done as you your ſelf can be: For they will look upon themſelves to be intereſted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in every thing that happens or belongs to you, and in perilous times will run any hazard to keep you out of danger; and the times cannot be ſo peaceable, nor any Perſon in ſo ſecure a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but before he dyes he may ſtand in need of the fidelity of his Servants.</p>
            <p>Look not too narrowly into the leſſer faults of your Servants, and don't take notice of every ſmall errour; for that will only tend to render both you and they uneaſie. If any thing happen purely by accident, and not through negligence, be not angry, but calmly admoniſh them to be more circumſpect for the future. If you have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to reprove any Servant, let it at firſt be in private, and calmly without paſſion, and as far as you can to convince him of his Sin: If after this he commits the like offence, reprove him more ſharply; and if he gives you further occaſion, then reprove him before the whole Family, for perhaps ſhame may work upon him when all other methods will prove ineffectual, and it may be prevent the like in ſome others of your Family. But how far you will ſuffer them before you turn them away, muſt be left to your own diſcretion;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:58538:23"/>though for my own part I would bear a great deal before I would turn away a Servant; for to change them often, is neither profitable nor commendable; for the World is too apt to believe that the fault is rather in the Maſter, than the Servant, when they change their Servants often.</p>
            <p>In the management of your buſineſs, do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend too much upon the honeſty of any, and be as much in it your ſelf as you can: For no Man is too <hi>great or good</hi> to look after his Affairs, and he that in ſome meaſure does not, it is an argument either of his ignorance or folly; by either of which he muſt ſuffer, as well in the opinion of the World, as in his Fortune. And remember the old adage, That the Maſters eye makes the Horſe fat, which is as much as to ſay, that his inſpection makes his Servants to add to their diligence: They that are faithful, it will incourage them, becauſe you your ſelf can bear witneſs to their indeavours; and thoſe that are more remiſs, there is the greater occaſion to obſerve them.</p>
            <p>In the management of your Eſtate take theſe Directions along with you. In the letting of your Demeans or other Farms, it being ſuppoſed you will get the beſt Rent you can, it ſeems adviſable to let them for Twenty One Years, and as often as you can to take a Fine of about a Years value, and then the Yearly Rent to abate proportionably to what the Fine and Intereſt of it will amount to at the end of the Term: For as by this you can be no looſer if your Rent be duely paid; ſo it is the moſt probable way to have it well paid, in regard that if your Tenant be behind with his Rent, if it be not above a Year, this Fine will ſet you right. In the next place, the payment of the Fine is a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:58538:23"/>ſtrong argument of the Ability of your Farmer; and beſides, a Rent that is leſs than the full worth of the Farm is better paid, than when it is at the utmoſt value. And farthermore by paying of a leſſer Rent, Farmers are incouraged to make im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, whereby your Rent is not only bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſecured, but alſo at the expiration of their Leaſe the Farm is better for it.</p>
            <p>In the next place, tye your Farmers to <hi>Repairs,</hi> for they will do that for Six pence, which they will ſet down to you at Eighteen Pence.</p>
            <p>And becauſe plowing is the deſtruction of moſt Farms, bind out your Farmer from plowing either Meadow or any other ground that is not proper to be broke up. In the next place, let at leaſt one half of the reſt of the ground be imployed only in <hi>Paſture.</hi> Then oblige him to muck or manure at leaſt a third part as much as he plows every Year; and if he break up any ground that he has already muckt, then for the remainder of his Term that he muck every Year ſuch ground as he has already broken up; and by this means your Farm will be as good a pennyworth at the end of the Term, as when he took it. Beſides theſe general Rules, I can preſcribe you none, ſave to take good ſecurity for the performance of his Covenants, and to appoint ſome perſon to ſee whether he fail in any of them.</p>
            <p>As for ſuch part of your Eſtate as is upon Leaſes for Lives or Years, my Opinion is, that if all of it were for Leaſes of Twenty One Years, it would be beſt both for Tenant and Landlord. Firſt, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it would put the Tenants upon ſome ſort of Induſtry, which is too much neglected by ſuch as have Leaſes for Lives. And 2. Becauſe the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:58538:24"/>would then be at a certainty, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he knew how to diſpoſe his Affairs. Therefore if you renew ſuch Leaſes as are upon Years, let it be again for Years; and if you leaſe any that fall out of Leaſe, let them alſo be for Twenty One Years.</p>
            <p>Then as to renewing Leaſes for Lives; If one Life is to be added to Two yet remaining, take Two years value to do it, unleſs one or both of the remaining Lives be very Aged or Infirm, for then you may expect half, or a Years value more, as the caſe may fall out. If but one Life remain, and two more are to be added to it, then take five Years value, unleſs extream Age and Infirmity alter the caſe: For the changing of a Life take one Years value, unleſs the aforeſaid Objections lye in the way: But never change any Life ſave where there are three Lives in the Leaſe, neither add one Life when one only remains, unleſs upon an extraordinary conſideration. Now as to the value of a Tenement, my intention is what it is worth when your old Rent and Services are dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; for if thoſe be not abated out of the value, you make your Tenants pay for what they have not; And 2. Your Treatment of them would be unequal, becauſe ſome are much higher rented than others, and an equal hand gives great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to Tenants.</p>
            <p>Tenants may well afford to give theſe Rates, and grow Rich by their Landlord, becauſe they are under the worth of what they would take of a Stranger. And if the Tenants will keep their Leaſes full, Landlords may afford to take theſe Rates, though under the true value. And that you may as well feel the real advantage, as have
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:58538:24"/>the Reputation of ſuch an Eſtate as I hope by Gods Bleſſing to leave you; if any Tenement fall out of Leaſe, let it for the beſt improved Rent you can get: For as it happened through the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence or perverſeneſs of the Tenant that the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement fell out of Leaſe; ſo neither Conſcience, Law, nor Equity can compel you to diſpoſe of it any other way than to you ſhall ſeem beſt: And without ſome ſuch hank as this, you will find your Tenants will never be prevailed upon to renew their Leaſes, but when their own convenience or neceſſity invites or compells them to it, although your Affairs are never ſo preſſing for Money.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Children</hi> are at firſt a blank paper, upon which you may write what you will; and therefore great care is to be taken of the firſt Impreſſion that is made upon them: For it is ſeldom ſeen but that much of it remains with them to their dying day; and <hi>Solomon</hi> is of this Opinion, for he ſays, <hi>Train up a Child in the way wherein he ſhould go, and he will not forget it when he is old.</hi> Therefore take care to poſſeſs them early with the fear of God, and a ſenſe of Religion: For if they are void of that, they will prove no better than pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your ſides, and conſequently bring down your gray hairs (if you attain to ſuch an Age) with ſorrow to the Grave.</p>
            <p>Let their Education be ſuitable to their Quality, and what your Eſtate will bear, for thereby they may become a Comfort to you, and uſeful to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and eſpecially your Sons, in whom (if it be not for want of underſtanding) the Publick claims a great Intereſt, by reaſon of their Quality and Fortune.</p>
            <pb n="32" facs="tcp:58538:25"/>
            <p>When the ordinary Schools have gone as far with them as they can, then either take a Tutour into your Houſe, or ſend them to Travel, to be poliſh't; but by no means ſend them to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, unleſs you intend them for Divines or Phyſicians: For as it is great odds they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>debaucht,</hi> ſo all that they get there is a deal of <hi>Pedantick Learning,</hi> which is of no uſe to the Publick, and yet by means of it they grow ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confident, and impertinent and troubleſome in all places, and obſtinately opinionative, though never ſo much in the wrong.</p>
            <p>Children are to be governed neither wholly by Love, nor altogether by Fear; for by a right temperature of both you may lead them which way you will. To be eaſie and familiar with them, winns upon and confirms their affection and duty, and to treat them with too much awe, and at too great a diſtance, is to loſe a great deal of the pleaſure and ſatisfaction that is to be had in Children; and yet care is to be taken, that before Company they may know their diſtance.</p>
            <p>Give them liberty enough for <hi>Recreations,</hi> yet not ſo as to neglect their Studies: For as too much Liberty will occaſion them to mind nothing but Idleneſs, ſo too great a reſtraint will only prepare them to exceed all manner of bounds when they are their own Maſters.</p>
            <p>Though it is Natural, as well as our Duty, to love our Children; yet it will behove you to be watchful over your ſelves, leſt by being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doating or fond you forget to order and govern them as is meet. And it's not eaſie to determine, whether ſuch a doting fondneſs, or the want of Children is the greater unhappineſs. If we could
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:58538:25"/>believe and remember, that we have no faſter a hold of all that we poſſeſs, but as lent us for an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time, we ſhould uſe them more moderately, and conſequently part with them more eaſily, whenever it pleaſes God to call for any thing we have.</p>
            <p>Every Man that has ſeveral Children, loves one more than another; and if God ſhall bleſs you with many, take good heed that they may not diſcover the partiality of your affection, for the conſequence of it will be fatal both to you and them.</p>
            <p>To provide convenient Matches for your Daughters if you can, is without doubt your Duty, as alſo to give them good Portions, but not ſuch as will make your eldeſt Son uneaſie, for that is to give them more than comes to their Share; and if you do it out of a proſpect of advantage that may thereby accrue to your Family; yet if it be not certain, but only in probability, it is not adviſeable to do it: For your Daughter may forget the Stock from whence ſhe ſprang, and keep all to her ſelf; or her Husband upon Tryal may not like her, and ſo value her Family accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly; or if he thinks you matcht her to him in hopes to make advantage by him, it will be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral for him to make it his buſineſs to diſappoint you. Now whether it be for theſe or any other reaſons, I know not; but I have obſerved, that giving a Daughter an extraordinary Portion out of that deſign, has hurt many more Families than it has advantaged.</p>
            <p>In the matching of any of your Sons, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially your eldeſt, neither force, nor too much flatter him into the likeing of any, to whom his
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:58538:26"/>own Inclinations don't in ſome meaſure prompt him: For an Errour in this is like one in the firſt concoction, which can never be repaired: For if there be any diſlike in the Perſons, or their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions otherwiſe ingaged before they are married, though their diſcretion may make them to carry fair to each other, yet it has been ſeldom ſeen that afterwards there was any warmth of affection between them.</p>
            <p>A great Fortune is welcome to every Family; but he that only regards the plenty of Fortune, without conſidering the Woman, it is odds, but he is out in his reckoning: For if ſhe be not a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of competent diſcretion, he will fall ſhort in his account: In regard that if ſhe be highly born, ſhe will expect, and her Husband muſt have no quiet, unleſs ſhe be maintained according to her Quality, and the Fortune ſhe brought. If ſhe is of mean Parentage, yet her Wealth will make her to forget what ſhe was, and eſteem her ſelf according to her Portion and the Quality of her Husband, and as ſuch ſhe will expect to live: For being once on Horſe-back, ſhe will not know when it is time to alight, and ſo by her expencefulneſs leave her Husband no better than ſhe found him, if not worſe. And therefore a Woman of a <hi>middle birth,</hi> that is a Fortune is the moſt Eligible: For as her Birth will give no allay to your Blood, ſo in probability ſhe will more eaſily be perſwaded to a competent way of living, and verifie the true old Adage, That you are not ſo much to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard what a Wife brings, as what ſhe will ſave.</p>
            <p>The beſt way of providing Annuities for your Younger Sons, is by letting of Tenements run out of Leaſe, which will not only be an eaſe, but
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:58538:26"/>vantage to your Eldeſt: For as by this you will not narrow his preſent Revenue, ſo in ſuch Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements there will be but one Life; whereas there might probably have been two or three Lives apiece in them, had you renewed them as you did other Tenements.</p>
            <p>Thus, my <hi>dear Children,</hi> I have finiſhed theſe my Inſtructions, which I have been able to write out of my own experience, and for that reaſon ought not to be ſlighted by you. I hope you will live long enough, not only to practice, but alſo to improve them; yet not by my dear bought ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, who have been a Man of trouble from my Childhood. Now whether it ſhall be by Gods Bleſſing upon theſe or any other Advice, may you get through this troubleſome World with Peace, and when you dye be received into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom, So prays</p>

            <head>AN ESSAY UPON GOVERNMENT.</head>
            <p>THE various kinds of Government in the World are no leſs an Argument of Gods Wiſdom, than the many People and Languages that inhabit the Univerſe are an evidence of his Power, for had there been but one ſort of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the World, the Wiſdom of God had not therein been ſo manifeſt, ſince he that knows every road to ſuch a place, muſt be allowed to be ſo much more knowing in that particular, than he that is only acquainted with one of thoſe ways.</p>
            <p>Gods Government of the World is amazing when ſeriouſly conſider'd: And the moſt admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of it, is to obſerve, that the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of that Affair is guided not by expreſs Rules and Methods immediately by him delivered to the ſeveral People and Nations; but they are inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the inſtinct of Nature to chooſe that which is moſt conducible to ſupport their ſeveral Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Except in ſuch Caſes when God in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a People hides from their eyes the things that belong to their peace:</p>
            <p>Compare this Conſtitution in its proper Linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with other Governments, and this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:58538:27"/>will follow that we are the happieſt people under the Sun, for when our breaches are repair'd, then may that of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> the 4th. be truely ſaid of us. What Nation is there ſo great that hath Statutes and Judgments ſo righteous; for this Government has as it were extracted the good of all other conſtitutions, having avoided the two Extreams of Tyranny and an unbounded Liberty, no Government under the ſun being ſo exact a piece of Symetry having ſo equally poized the preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and property that they are mutually aſſiſtant of each other, whereby the adminiſtration is renderd ſo very eaſie, he who ſits at the helm having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to do to make himſelf the happyeſt Prince in the World, than to maintain a good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding betwixt himſelf and his People; and when that is wanting <hi>England</hi> is like a Ship that has loſt her Rudder. This Correſpondence is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom broak, but by things that do apparently por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, an utter eradication of our Antient Land-Marks: As when through inadvertency or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly any of our Neighbours are ſuffer'd to grow bigger than is conſiſtent with the ballance of Chriſtendom; though the effects of it are not ſoon felt, nor early foreſeen but by diſcerning People: Yet the Nation has always declined to give any aſſiſtance in it, becauſe they had no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of any advantage that would fall to their ſhare; and in a little time it has given great cauſe of diſcontent, becauſe they ſaw it did manifeſtly tend to break the ballance of the Government, and could be of no other uſe, than to ſerve the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of a Prince who is deſirous of Arbitrary Rule. But the diſſatisfactions betwixt the King and the People, do not ſo uſually proceed from this as
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:58538:28"/>from ſome other occaſions, and more obvious at firſt ſight. As when Parliaments are not ſuffer'd to meet and ſit according to the uſual times that the Law or neceſſity of Affairs do require: For the Government cannot long continue well when Parliaments are neglected, which is the only Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick to purge out thoſe Peccant Humours, that are contracted by time or accident; and is as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the well-being of it, as the Means uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made uſe of to preſerve the good Eſtate of a Natural Body: And the difuſe of Parliaments can no more be juſtified; than to have recourſe to Force and Violence, when right may more eaſily and certainly be had by the uſual methods of Law: Parliaments are the Medium, whereby the King is repreſented to the People in a true Light, and if it is wanting, it is no wonder, if he appear to them in a poſture of Offence, rather than of Defence: For when Parliaments are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued that mutual Complacency is loſt, which otherwiſe the conſtitution of the Government does naturally produce betwixt King and People. Changes ſeldom happen for the better, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the People will not be much delighted with the diſcontinuance of Parliaments, becauſe a more mild and equal way of governing has not yet been found out than what is preſcribed by <hi>Magna Charta;</hi> and though in this Change of Government the advantage ſhould fall on the Peoples ſide, yet they may ſuſpect that there is Death in the Pot, till it has proved it ſelf by its effects, becauſe by how much the advantage is on their part, by ſo much muſt the Kings Inches be pared; and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to advance rather than reſtrain their Power, is an Infirmity to which Kings as well as other
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58538:28"/>Men are ſubject: And thoſe Arbitrary Symptoms which ever do precede the laying aſide of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are no leſs than ſo many demonſtrations, that it muſt end in a Deſpotick Power. For there are ſeveral things which are only Cognizable in Parliament, and then this Dilemma will follow either that there muſt be a failer in Juſtice, or if any other Court or Authority do hold Juriſdiction of them, the whole proceeding would be Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, As for Example, The giving of Money, the Repeal of Old Laws, or Enacting of new Statutes, and the laſt reſort of Juſtice in Caſe of Appeals or Impeachments; for ſhould thoſe or any of them be treated of but in Parliament the Government would thereby become intirely De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotick.</p>
            <p>When a King attempts to find out a new way of governing, its an undeniable Argument that he is weary of the Old one; and that King of <hi>England</hi> who is uneaſie with the Ancient way of governing will never be pleaſed with any, but what gives up all into his hands. When any King of <hi>England</hi> has try'd the Experiment he has found in the Iſſue, that he had better to have let it alone: For whenever he has Wreſtled with the People, has in the Concluſion got the fall, and often been cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by it.</p>
            <p>Then next to this like a younger Brother of the ſame ill Family, and bears the ſecond ill Character to the laying aſide of Parliaments, is when the Privy Council is turned into a Cabinet, the former being only kept up for a ſhew, and to give a Reputation to the Advices and Proceedings of the latter. A Cabinet Council may at firſt ſeem but a ſmall Evil, yet it conceives and brings forth many Ugly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences:
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:58538:29"/>For it is ever the fore-runner of the neglect of Parliaments, which thing alone is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to give the People an utter diſlike of it. And beſides the King does hereby forbid all others but thoſe of the Cabinet either to come near him, or give him any Advice: For what incouragement has any other of the Privy Council to offer their Sence, conſidering that if it does not jump with that of the Cabinet, their Advice ſhall not only be rejected, but every thing that fell from them will be improved as much as it can bear to their diſadvantage; and therefore in a ſhort time they will as much undervalue the Attendance at the Council-Board, as the King does their Advice, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they are more fond of the bare Name of a Privy Councillor, than they are of their Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for what greater ſlight can be put upon Men of Senſe and Honour, than to be uſed only as a Foil to ſet off the Tranſactions of other Perſons not ſo deſerving and worthy as themſelves.</p>
            <p>A Cabinet Council keeps the King in the dark, he can hear but one ſide, and that the wrong one too, for honeſt Men ſeldom come there, for if any ſuch thing be propoſed unto them, unleſs they are leſs Wiſe than Honeſt, Their Anſwer will be, That <hi>in the multitude of Councillors is the King's ſafety:</hi> When a King has entered a Cabinet Council, he'll hardly come out the ſame Man, his very Nature and Diſpoſition will be changed by the conſtant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and Inſinuations of thoſe that he calls into that place, and ſo of a hopeful Succeſſor may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a very indifferent King. So great is the force of frequent and private Converſation.</p>
            <pb n="41" facs="tcp:58538:29"/>
            <p>He was a Wiſe Man, who ſaid, That in gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the way as well as the end, ought to be clear. From whence no Argument can be rais'd for a Cabinet Council; the methods of that being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and uncertain, and in no ſort conſiſtent with the honeſt and plain way of this or any other po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Government, for reaſon of State is not found in our Law Books or Statutes, and the <hi>Arcana imperii</hi> mentioned by ſuch as write of the Politicks are adapted for Governments where will rather than any known and certain Law is the meaſure of it; for though the King of <hi>England</hi> may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo well appized in the uſe of them, yet he is never ſo much out of his way as when he puts that knowledge into practice, and therefore plain and open Councils are the leaſt ſuſpected, beſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood and approved; an honeſt man after he has told his Story, is not afraid to let any man elſe be heard, what he ſays is like true Mettal that will abide the touch. Whereas the Advice of Knaves, like Thieves or Beaſts of Prey lurks in holes, and ſhrouds it ſelf under the Darkneſs; is afraid to come near the Light becauſe it will not indure the day. And there is this further difference betwixt open and private advice, for the former ſeldom fails, and the latter as ſeldom meets with ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>This cloſe way of giving and taking advice is ever attended with the Kings retiring from the ſight of his People; being ſeldom ſeen, and more difficult to be ſpoke with: For it is the Policy of ſuch as have him in their hands, to keep him as much as they can within their own Circle, becauſe it's the ſureſt way to maintain the ground they have got, and to gain what they want: But when a King thus hides himſelf, it is becauſe he is either
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:58538:30"/>aſhamed or afraid to be ſeen; and when he is ſhy of being ſeen; the People in a ſhort time will as little value the ſight of him, as he is willing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf to view: To be quick of diſpatch and eaſie of acceſs is the Character of a right States-Man, and no Prince ever loſt ground by practiſing it himſelf, for the contrary Method ruines Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip amongſt private Perſons, and a King will quickly find the ill Effects of it: It may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected that familiarity breeds contempt; but that King is very ill skilled in Mediums, who is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the time and manner of receiving his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, ſo as to diſmiſs them from his preſence with content and ſatisfaction, without looſing that due diſtance that ought to be kept betwixt him and them: And the loweſt condeſcentions and meaneſt familiarity cannot looſe a Prince ſo much as too much retiredneſs, or being over-reſerved. And this retiredneſs, like Twins born together, is uſually attended with ſuch a ſlowneſs in every thing that half the Effect is loſt before they are put in Execution. As in beſtowing Imployments or other Favours, the Party does for the moſt part attend ſo long, till thereby the thing receives ſo great an allay, and comes with ſo ill a Grace, that half the obligation is loſt before it is given. And the delatorineſs in all other Matters looſes much of the advantage that might have been had by a quicker diſpatch, and often creates a neceſſity to ſupply by a ſecond Act what was loſt by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay in the firſt, and though at laſt the point may be gain'd, yet being forc't to do that at twice which might have bin done at once, is no great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to ſuch Methods. Diſpatch being the life of Execution as ſteddineſs is of Council: And this
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:58538:30"/>ſlow progreſs is almoſt unavoidable; for theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have hemmed the King in, will not looſe the advantage that is to be had in diſpoſing of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; they will keep the Candidates as long as they can in ſuſpence to ſee who will bid higheſt, whereas a greater diſpatch in the diſpoſing of them would be the loſs of ſeveral Viſions of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, which elſe they may hope to ſee, and much more haſte cannot well be expected in other things, by reaſon that the proceedings are in a new way, more uncertain and round about, and ſo very much depending upon every ſtep. Its no wonder if there be ſo much Caution and Jealouſie as to make the reſolutions and execution far ſlower, than if they had been managed in the Old Track.</p>
            <p>What has bin ſaid does not argue againſt a due Care and Circumſpection, ſo as not to prevent all precipitancy, raſhneſs, or indiſcreet haſte, and yet the Caution, that goes further than ſo, is needleſs, and that which turns to the prejudice of it, is in no ſort to be juſtified: And though by an unuſual ſlowneſs a point may have bin gain'd, yet there is no more reaſon for the future to take that Method in other Caſes, than to make uſe of a deſperate remedy in all Caſes, becauſe it once had good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and there is as little reaſon to obſerve the ſame Rules and Methods in all Governments, for that Prince who does ſo, it argues his inſufficiency to govern. But the moſt fatal conſequence of a Cabinet Council is, that in a ſhort time it diſpoſes the King to be weary and uneaſie with Men of Intereſt and Deſert, their Room being more welcome to him than their Company, and then he lays hold on every occaſion to put ſlights upon them, and to ſhuffle them out of their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:58538:31"/>for his Appetite being depraved by thoſe of the Cabinet, he cannot relliſh, thoſe wholeſome Advicee which the others think they are bound in duty to offer him; but when the King makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſtrange to ſuch Men, the People won't believe that he has any good meaning to them: They may ſuſpect that their Properties are in danger, when thoſe that have bin the great Defenders of them are in no credit with him: No Man ever got the good Opinion of the Nation, till by the whole Courſe of his Actions he had made it evident, that he preſerved the Publick good to his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Advantage; and therefore if the King does account the Publick Good and his Intereſt to be the ſame thing, who ought he then ſo much to eſteem as thoſe who are in the good liking of the Nation, who ought he ſo much to incourage, or on whom ſo much to depend as they: For their Advice will be faithful, and he may be ſure as none are ſo able to ſerve him as they, ſo none will be more ready and forward: When he imploys none but ſuch as theſe, and values every Man according to the rate that the Nation ſets upon him; he then at once bows the hearts of all the People, as one Man; and thereby becomes as ſafe and great, both at home and abroad, as the Wiſdom, Blood and Treaſure of the Land can make him; it makes every Man believe that it is more his Intereſt to preſerve the Kings Life, than to ſecure his own, and that it is his duty to make the King eaſie in every reſpect, rather than to increaſe the Wealth and Proſperity of his own Family; that which uſed to be ſo tedious and uneaſie to other Kings, will be laid upon the ſhoulders of the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for every Man will make it his buſineſs that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58538:31"/>no detriment ſhall befal the Kings Affairs; Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations for Libels and Reflections upon the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment will then be uſeleſs, for neither his Name nor Adminiſtration, will never be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd but with all reſpect and beſeeming expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and thoſe hours which thoſe at Court uſed to ſpend in undermining each other, will be wholly imploy'd in his Service, and in ſhort he may be gratified in every thing that his heart can deſire: But if he lay ſuch Men aſide, then as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally as Corruption ſuceeds Death, their rooms muſt be ſupply'd by others, who have neither In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, Principle, nor Morality, but are Compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of Knave and Fool, the very Scum of the Land, and will do any thing without asking a queſtion, provided they be well paid, and the reſult of all their Advice will be to eſtrange his Heart from his People: But when the Nation ſhall perceive him to be thus encompaſſed, they will not be ſo prone to truſt him as to obſerve his proceedings, for under ſuch Circumſtances his aſpect muſt be very Malevolent, what good can be hoped for, when he accounts them the fitteſt to ſerve him, and the propereſt object of his favour, whom the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may juſtly repute their Enemies; but well may they be alarum'd, when ſuch are imploy'd as were obnoxious in the time of his Predeceſſor; for it's a certain argument either of the unskilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or foulneſs of a Gameſter, when he deſires to play with marked Cards, ſo neceſſary it is for Kings to conſider well who they imploy, becauſe the People Judge of the King according to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of thoſe that are about him. Wiſely therefore did <hi>H.</hi> IV. upon an addreſs of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons remove ſeveral Perſons that he was very tender of ſaying he did it not that he could accuſe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:58538:32"/>them of any thing, but becauſe the People had an ill Opinion of them, for he knew that they were competent Judges in the caſe. And as Politick was it of <hi>H.</hi> VIII. to give up <hi>Empſon</hi> and <hi>Dudley</hi> to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, who might have done as much for him as they had done for his Father, but he conſidered that to part with the hearts of the People for all the Wealth they could procure him would be a very ill bargain, for he underſtood he might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all that was his Subjects, ſo long as he and they were upon good terms, and that King is not much diſpoſed to be well with his People; when he is fond of a few Men, who cannot pretend to any great merit, But when the King ſhall once in good earneſt take Men of dependance by the hand, he'll quickly find himſelf alone with them: For all Men of worth and honour will of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord be as forward to quit their Imployments, as he is willing to put them out; becauſe the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs that they have for their reputations will not allow them to mingle with worſer men than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the rather becauſe it would give coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to the irregular and diſobliging Methods which may be adviſed to by the other ſort of men: And for this they will not be the worſe thought on by their Country, but like Gold ten times purified; they return home with all the advantage that can be, and thoſe who honoured them before, will then fall down and worſhip them; no Man ever has loſt the eſteem he had got with the People; for being turn'd out at Court, it being a great miſtake that any Man will be leſſen'd in the Opinion of the Nation by being turn'd out of his Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment either becauſe he gave bold Advice, or would not comply againſt his Judgment, or elſe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58538:32"/>by quitting of his place rather than by ſtaying to give a countenance to other Mens proceedings, for in ſuch Caſes the King ſuffers more in the good Opinion of the People than the Perſon whom he diſmiſs'd from his Service; and in what a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition is that King who has loſt the hearts of his People, for nothing on Earth can repair it or be an equivalent; and how ſhall he recover their affections, when honeſt Men are fled from him, and none are left near him but ſuch as whoſe intereſt it is to keep him at a diſtance from his People: And though he may return to a right mind, and pretend and promiſe never ſo fair, yet the Nation and every honeſt and wiſe Man will be Jealous, that every advance he makes is only a Maſque or Diſguiſe that he puts on, and not that his heart is right in the matter.</p>
            <p>Now when ill Men are imploy'd and advanced as well as others; The pretence is either becauſe of their great abilities or uſefulneſs, or elſe that in point of Policy it is convenient to make uſe of all men without diſtinction; for this indulgence will allay heats, and put an end to differences, and unite all into the ſame intereſt, whereas if any are left out, they are thereby cut off from the Common Intereſt, and only thoſe ſort of Men can be depended on, who are thus favoured and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd: This will not bear ſo much weight as at firſt ſight it ſeems to carry.</p>
            <p>Ability or fitneſs is the firſt ſtep to preferment, and that is a happy Government that conſiders it in Perſons before they are imploy'd, but let Men be never ſo able, yet if they are defective in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, the <hi>unum neceſſarium</hi> is wanting, for a Man of Ability without Honeſty is like a Ship with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:58538:33"/>ballaſt, he cannot move ſteddily, every little wind of advantage carries him to and fro, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and forwards, and he never ſticks at any point longer than he can ſerve himſelf by it: If there can ever be a neceſſity of making uſe of an ill Man, it muſt be becauſe his knowledge tranſcends the reſt of Mankind, or elſe becauſe another wiſe Man cannot be found; but <hi>England</hi> was never yet ſo barren of able men, that there was a neceſſity of imploying Knaves or Men obnoxious; when ever the Nation falls under ſuch Circumſtances it is then viſited with a ſore Judgment: To make uſe of Knaves is ever a remedy worſe than the Diſeaſe; ſeldom any good, but frequently a great deal of miſchief enſues upon it, and the Ability of any Perſon if he be a Knave is rather an Argument to avoid than imploy him; becauſe by how much the more able he is, by ſo much is he capable of doing the greater miſchief: To allay heats and animoſities, to put an end to future differences, and to unite all Parties, is an excellent deſign, and a great happyneſs if it could be effected: But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all care is to be taken that whileſt one ſtorm is laying, a greater is not thereby raiſed, and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt in the conjuring down of one Devil, it does not raiſe two, and in the making up of Diviſions worſer are created thereby; and by gaining one E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy Twenty Friends are loſt, and nothing ſeems to lead ſo directly to it, as equally and without diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to imploy men of all ſorts and Opinions, and there is another Method that will give leſs cauſe of diſcontent to any Party: For it will be agreed. That to pardon a Criminal is as great an act of goodneſs, as to reward the good Service of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perſon. If all have equal Right, and ſpeedy
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:58538:33"/>Juſtice impartially be done to every Man, this muſt be confeſſed to be a Righteous Government, and if it be not too extream to mark what is done amiſs, nor too ſtrickt to meaſure every Offender a Peck out of his own Sack, nor too rigidly to judge eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man according to his own Law, this muſt be allow'd to be a merciful Government, and if at the ſame time the King beſtows his favours and imployments only on ſuch as beſt deſerve them; where is the injuſtice or partiality of this procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or who can juſtly take offence at any part of it? And therefore when a King does equally and without diſtinction beſtow his Favours and Imployments on all Intereſts and Parties, there ought to be three things in the caſe; Firſt, That all Parties are equal. Secondly, That he cannot depend upon one more than another. Thirdly, That his Obligations to all Parties are equal: Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of which is very ſtrange when it is ſo, but much more wonderful will it be when they all happen together.</p>
            <p>For as to the firſt, It is not eaſie to imagine that all Parties will ever be ſo equal, ſo as that no one will be bigger than any of the reſt, no more than it can be ſuppoſed that all Men will ever have an equal meaſure of underſtanding; uninterrupted expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience proves that it never was ſo, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to induce us to believe that it ever will be ſo: For ſo long as there are either Fools or Knaves, there will be difference in the ſize and ſtrength of Parties, and there will be Fools and Knaves till Chriſts Kingdom comes.</p>

               </gap>s to the ſecond it may be ſaid, That it will be a very extraordinary juncture, whenever it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that the King cannot depend upon one Party
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:58538:34"/>more than upon another, ſince the reaſon of it will be this, becauſe the Principles of every party will be equally dangerous or advantagious to the King, or equally different or agreeable to his, this is a remote ſuppoſition, and cannot be expected on this ſide the Grave, and therefore it will follow, that he cannot have a like confidence of all Parties, but muſt depend upon ſome more than upon others, and this dependance will naturally fix it ſelf, either on them whoſe Principle it is to ſupport the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good, or elſe on ſuch as are more diſpoſed to comply with his Will and Pleaſure: For Principle is the great Director of all Mans Actions, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man is either better or worſe eſteemed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Opinion that the World has of his Principles: In the worſt and moſt corrupt of times, there has not wanted ſuch as have been more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous about the well-fair of their Country, than for themſelves, and if a King does not ſo much depend upon thoſe that by the current of their Actions have made it evident, they prefer the Publick Good to their own private Advantage, as upon ſome other ſort of Men, it's as clear as the Sun that he aims at ſomething beſide the Publick Weal, or elſe that God has a quarrel to him, and will not let him ſee his Intereſt. For what greater pledge can be given of a Mans Integrity, than when voluntarily, and without Compulſion he dedicates himſelf, and all that he has to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſervice, any other ſecurity being inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in compariſon of it: And therefore when a King knows ſuch Men, and yet imploys others rather than they, it's a clear Demonſtration that his Deſigns and Affections are alienated from the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58538:34"/>good of his People, and the Land is then in as ill a condition as when their King is a Child.</p>
            <p>As to the third it will be no leſs extraordinary to ſee the King under equal Obligations to all Parties, for it can only be for this reaſon, becauſe every Party ſhall have approved themſelves equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerviceable or uſeleſs, faithful or negligent, ſteddy or inconſtant, to him, which would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wonderful, though he dropt out of the Skies, becauſe there are ſo very many occaſions in which a King needs the ſervice of his People, that if one Party acquit themſelves better than others, he will in a little time find who deſerves beſt, and it will be ſo plain and obvious that he muſt ſee it, unleſs he be very unfortunate: And till all Men have the ſame Complexion, are of the ſame Stature and proportion of Body and Temper of Mind, there will be diſtinctions of Men and Parties; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will be the moſt remarkable thing that ever happen'd, that notwithſtanding their differences in other matters, yet they ſhould all concur to have the ſame Principle and Inclination to the King and Government. But that Prince is very unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, who cannot depend upon one Party more than another, nor has obligations to one more than another, ſince it is an ill effect of a bad cauſe: For the reaſon wherefore he cannot depend upon one more than another, is becauſe he has uſed and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all alike: And this Method as it will never make his Enemies to become his Friends, ſo in a ſhort time it will make his Friends ſo cold and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different towards him, that they will ſerve him at the rate that others do, and hereby his Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions won't be greater to one more than to another. So the Service that is done him will not be the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58538:35"/>effect of Duty and Affection, but only according to the rate that he pays them. But when a King cannot depend upon one more than another, and is under equal obligations to all the moſt uſual and trueſt reaſon of all is, becauſe he has ſo far diſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd all Parties that he has more cauſe to be afraid of than to truſt any of them; therefore till Men are of the ſame mind in every thing elſe; it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be expected that theſe things, or any of them can ever happen: If then ſhould a King act as if they were, and the Caſe prove to be otherwiſe, the conſequence of it, would be fatal to him: For though it may be objected, that by a diſtribution of his favours and imployments equally on all Parties, he thereby gives incouragement to all to ſtand by him, and makes none deſperate, yet on the other hand, he thereby makes every Party Jealous of him, and none to truſt him: For when he inlarges his hand to any Party, it is to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret and envy of the reſt that were not then alſo conſider'd, which he cannot repair but by confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring greater things on them, and then this turns to the diſſatisfaction of the other Party as much as if nothing had been done for them. So that thence it will follow, that when ever his bounty moves, every one muſt have a ſhare, for if any Party is omitted, he will loſe more on one hand than he gains on the other; and what Prince ever found that his bounty turn'd to account where the Perſons that were the objects of it, had not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of affection or duty for him, becauſe all that he can do in that way will ingage them no longer than till they can make a better bargain, or could he winn them by it, yet the caſe of that Prince is much to be lamented who has none to depend on,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58538:35"/>but ſuch as he has gained by his liberality: But could he gain any by ſuch a Method which is very uncertain, yet for one that he ſo makes his Friend he thereby looſes a hundred who are ſuch upon principle, and that Prince gives himſelf very little leaſure to think, who does not know that one who is a Friend upon Principle is worth many who are made ſuch by bounty, preferments may be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, but Principles are permanent: Every Prince will find himſelf out in his reckoning, when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives what conſtruction the People do put upon ſuch a Method, for they will be apt to conclude, That it is the effect of Fear, want of underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or that his heart is not right towards them, and its a dangerous thing to ſuffer ſuch Notions to get into their heads, it being very difficult to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them if once they are fixt there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thoſe that wiſht him well will grow cold and indifferent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, when they find that others who don't deſerve it are treated as well as themſelves, and it will diſcourage the honeſt endeavours of others for the future, when neither they nor the Nation is much the better for their ſervice, and at laſt they will deſpiſe him; and ſuch as had no great good will for him will be ſure to follow their blow as ſoon as they find his blind ſide, and improve to their utmoſt advantage, though to the ruine of him and the Nation; all Parties will ſlight him, underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue all his Actions, put the worſt conſtruction up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every thing, and aſcribe to chance whatever is well done. When obnoxious Men are made uſe of, it is too evident a ſign that the ſame work is to be done, becauſe the ſame Tools come into play, and hereby the King in a great meaſure becomes <hi>Particeps criminis</hi> of former ill councels and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58538:36"/>in allowing ſuch to ſuck the fat of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment who ought to be ſqueazed if not cruſhed to ſatisfie and vindicate the publick Juſtice, and then well may ſuch wipe their mouths and ſay, What evil have I done, when in ſtead of anſwering at the Bar, their Treatment is more like a Reward for what they have done, and thereby they are confirmed in their Wickedneſs, and all honeſt and deſerving Men diſcouraged. When a King calls ſuch Perſons near him as ought for ever to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht his preſence, every Man elſe that is more deſerving will withdraw themſelves, becauſe not conſiſtant with their Honour to herd with any who are unworthy the places they hold, and ſo in a ſhort time the King will be left deſtitute of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil or any to defend him, and expoſed to his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies both at home and abroad, and his own People ſo prepared, (that when any fair occaſion offers it ſelf) to cry out, <hi>Nolumus hunc regn are,</hi> and thereby from a Potent King may become a Nominal Prince and no more.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter then: May not that Prince be judged to be born under an untoward Conſtellation, who goes out of his way when it Iyes ſo open and directly before him, or that ſplits upon a Rock, which he may more eaſily avoid than fall upon it: For that which is neceſſary to make him as happy as a King can be, is not more difficult than what was required of the <hi>Syrian</hi> General to cure his Leproſie, the one was bid to waſh and be clean, and the other to keep fair with his People; and what they deſire is reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and juſt in relation to themſelves, and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and ſafe for him, and is the thing in the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58538:36"/>World that can add moſt to the Excellency of His Majeſty, and the Might of His Power.</p>
            <p>When a Prince miſtakes his way for want of experience or a true repreſentation of the State of Affairs, this is an Error on the right hand, and there remains hopes of his return, but when it proceeds from his own inclinations, and it is the dictates of his own breaſt, then it is an evil that threatens the Land during his Life, becauſe nothing but ſome very preſſing neceſſity can make him alter his courſe: How great a Bleſſing or a Burden then is a King to the Land, and how ought a good one to be valued, and a bad one to be dreaded, ſince there is no Medium betwixt thoſe two; and ſince ſo much of the good or evil depends upon the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices that are given him, how careful does it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hove him to be in the choice of his Council, and then how highly ought he and the Nation to value ſuch, who ſet light by any Imployment when it ſtands in Competition with their Duty.</p>
            <p>That King then who is inform'd of and ſees his miſtake and does not rectifie it, will leave no good Character behind him, but he that finds he is out of his way, and returns to the right path is both Wiſe and Juſt, and he that always keeps in the right road is a fortunate Prince.</p>
            <p>But to ſay that his adminiſtration was unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and yet from the firſt reſolved that if he did ſlip aſide, he could not ſooner diſcover his Error, than he would ſet things to right, is the greateſt Character of a King.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ACcording to my promiſe, when we were laſt together, I ſend you my further thoughts upon what we then diſcourſed.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing (as I remember) that we had under our conſideration, was an Inquiry into the true and real cauſe of King <hi>James</hi>'s running away from <hi>Salisbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I then was and am ſtill of opinion, that he was acted by Fear more than by any thing elſe, from the firſt Notice that he had of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> his deſign to the Moment that he got into <hi>France;</hi> Nothing but fear could make him neglect what is ſo expedient upon ſuch occaſions. That is to clap up every Man of Quality or Intereſt that he ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; but he was ſo far from laying hold of any man, that he courted and even humbled himſelf to thoſe very people whom before he would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit into his preſence, and with ſo much abjected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs made an offer of their Charter and Franchiſes to the City of <hi>London</hi> and other Corporations.</p>
            <p>What elſe but Fear could put him upon ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politick a thing, as to ſend for ſo very many <hi>Iriſh?</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:58538:37"/>For not to inſiſt upon their inſufficiency to help him at a dead lift, had he conſulted his reaſon, he muſt have foreſeen the diſcontents and diviſions that it would create in his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Forces; for it ſhewed that he repoſed a confidence in the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> even to a diſtruſt in the fidelity and ſufficiency of the reſt of his Army, and a diſtruſt at any time, much more at that would be felt very ſenſibly, though toucht never ſo lightly; and therefore if he could not be confident of his Army before, he might expect that this would diſpoſe them to a Revolt upon the firſt occaſion that they ſhould meet with: Could any thing but Fear diſpoſe him to thoſe methods which he took to oppoſe the Prince at his firſt landing? For as upon a Fright all the Blood retires to the Heart; ſo he drew all his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my together, and reckoned himſelf ſo much the ſafer, by how much leſs diſtance any part of his Forces were from him, thereby neglecting the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that he had againſt the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> whom he was certain muſt land either in the Weſt or North, and eight or ten thouſand men ſent down to each of thoſe places to receive him at his land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, might either have deſtroyed his Army, or elſe have broke it ſo much, that a ſmall ſupply of Freſh men in a few days would have made an end of that Matter, if withal he had diſperſed a few of his Forces conveniently up and down the reſt of <hi>England,</hi> which would either have wholly prevented, or hindred any conſiderable Aſſiſtance from coming into the Prince; for the Nation had been rid ſo long, that little of the old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Spirit was left, and moſt who declared for the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> proceeded with ſo much caution, that they ſhewed more Cunning than Courage, as I will
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:58538:38"/>ſhew you by and by; and beſides thoſe Forces thus placed to prevent any that ſhould appear for the Prince, could in a few days joyn that Body that was to attack the Prince when he landed, and have made up a Force conſiderable enough to ingage his, that did not exceed 12 or 13000, having loſt moſt of their beſt Horſes, and the Men much weakned and diſheartned, by the Stormes, and lying long on Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, or had they come on more equal terms, it was doubtful whether they could have kept their ground againſt an equal number of King <hi>James</hi> his Army: But had King <hi>James</hi> his firſt Body been routed, yet the remainder of his Forces far excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Number the Princes, and would have found him freſh work, over and over, if King <hi>James</hi> would have ſtaid with them. But this Method ſo prudent and obvious he refuſed, and as little made uſe of the other which he took. He quartered all his Army in and about <hi>London,</hi> till he heard the Prince was landed, when he ordered it to march, and followed it in Perſon, only to expoſe himſelf the more, and give the clearer evidence of his Cowardice, for before he came within 40 Miles of his Enemy away he ran as faſt as if his whole Army had been routed, his fear ſo far prevailing upon him that he durſt not ſtay to ſet the two Armies together by the Ears, in ſo much haſt was he to get out of <hi>England:</hi> And being ſtopt at <hi>Feverſham,</hi> and brought back to <hi>White-hall,</hi> where he received the Princes Meſſage to remove, how meanly did he conſent to it? whereas if he had had the leaſt grain of Courage, he might eaſily have ſecured thoſe that brought the Meſſage, and cut in pieces the Forces that came with them. To do it he wanted not incouragement by the Bonefires and Huzzahs
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58538:38"/>with which the City received him; and if he had, it would have ſtruck ſuch a Conſternation upon the Princes Forces, and ſo raiſed the Spirit of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and of the Papiſts who were then very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous in <hi>London,</hi> that it would have ſo turned the Tables as to bring the Odds on his ſide; but his Fear would not let him ſee his advantage, and ſo multiplied every thing that was againſt him, that at any rate he would be gone, and ſave his life, though at the Price of his Honour and three Kingdoms: So that if all were true that is reported of his former Proweſs, yet he ſeems therein to have forct himſelf and acted a part, for it could not be the effect of Courage and Reſolution; and upon the whole Matter, never Man (even <hi>Nero</hi> himſelf) ſhewed ſo much Fear in any Caſe as King <hi>James</hi> did in that Matter.</p>
            <p>From this we proceeded to conſider what it was that ſet the ſlaviſh Paſſion afloat, and we found it was the Concurrance of three things. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Princes Forces. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The deſertion in his Army. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The declaration of the Nobility and Gentry in ſeveral parts of <hi>England</hi> for the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> and then we inquired which of theſe weighed moſt, and therein firſt we took into conſideration how far the Princes Forces went in the Matter.</p>
            <p>It muſt be conſidered that their Numbers could not make them very formidable, ſince they did not exceed 12 or 13000 Men: That the condition they were in, did not render them very terrible, many of their Men being ſick, and all diſcouraged by the great Storms, and lying long on Shipboard; moſt of their beſt Horſes killed, and the reſt ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred almoſt unfit for ſervice; And that the <hi>Dutch</hi>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:58538:39"/>were never eſteemed very famous for Land ſervice, though they behave themſelves very well at Sea. King <hi>James</hi> was not ignorant of any part of this, And on the other hand, his Army was in great health, and alwayes well paid, and in Number much Superiour to the Princes Forces, by reaſon of which, in probability, it muſt have neceſſitated the Prince to get four or five Victories, before he could ſecure the Matter, and had loſt all his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, if King <hi>James</hi> got the better in any one Battle. King <hi>James</hi> knew he had in his Army of old diſciplined Troops, <hi>Papiſts</hi> and biggoted <hi>Tories,</hi> who in number equalled if not exceeded the Princes Forces, and would have found them, or any ſuch Body of Men, work enough upon more equal terms; He very well knew that <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> ſeldom turn their backs, and will go as far as their Officers will lead them; He had a great number of <hi>Papiſts</hi> in his Army, and was ſenſible that they thought it to be their Intereſt to fight, by reaſon that their all lay at ſtake, and conſidering how their <hi>Prieſts</hi> would puſh them on to fight it to the laſt man, he might confidently expect if they were ingaged, they would ſell their Lives at a dear rate, rather than looſe the day: He knew he exceeded the Prince either in Horſe or Foot, even as to the number or goodneſs of Horſe, in which the ſtrength of the Princes Army conſiſted; And though it may be Objected, That the Prince had with him the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt General of the World, and a great number of good Officers, and that his were old Troops, and had been in Service; yet the beſt Officers could not make them more than they were, nor put them into a better condition; It muſt alſo be conſidered, that King <hi>James</hi> had a great many
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58538:39"/>Men that had been in Service; and new ones mixt with them, would together do as good Service, as if they had all been old Souldiers; and beſides, their <hi>all</hi> then lying at ſtake, would be ſure to make them perform what could be expected from Men, deſpair often anſwering to numbers and the greateſt conduct. So that the thought of the Princes Forces could not be the only thing that ſent King <hi>James</hi> away in ſuch haſte from <hi>Salisbury:</hi> For even the Prince though he thought as well of his Men, as he could do of ſuch a Number, yet he did not think them ſufficient without other aſſiſtance to ingage King <hi>James</hi> his Army, and therefore when he ſaw ſo very few to reſort to him after he had been ten or fourteen days on ſhore, he began to look towards his Ships, and had certainly gone away if the Scene had not changed very much in four or five days. This therefore makes it pretty plain, that the Princes Forces was not ſo very much the occaſion of putting King <hi>James</hi> into ſo great a Fright as ſomething elſe: And therefore in the next place we conſidered, how far the deſertion in his Army might contribute to it.</p>
            <p>Never had any Prince in his Army ſo many Men whom he had perſonally obliged, as King <hi>James</hi> had in his; for whileſt he was Duke of <hi>York,</hi> he was induſtrious to gain People of all Qualities, and what he did for any body as well whileſt he was Duke of <hi>York,</hi> as when he was King, was with ſo much diſpatch and ſo good a grace, that his Favours carried with them a double obligation, whereby he got the Character of a ſteddy Friend, though other things gave him that of an irreconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable Enemy; and there was in his Army a vaſt number, whom he had befriended to a great degree,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58538:40"/>whom no Overture could have prevailed with to have deſerted him, if they had had any ſort of gratitude, or ſence of Honour: And no doubt it was a great ſurprize upon him, when he found himſelf left in the lurch by them, who in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the world, could have no other intereſt than to ſtand by him to the laſt with all they had; and it muſt touch him very ſenſibly, conſidering that the Revolt of a ſmall part of any Army cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates a great diſorder in the reſt, and often proves fatal, becauſe they are in effect double to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of any other that come into the aſſiſtance of that Side, and renders all they leave behind them ſuſpected by their General; and therefore the Matter being thus ſingly conſidered, this may ſeem to preſs King <hi>James</hi> more than any thing elſe. But on the other hand it muſt be granted, that it was quickly diſcover'd how far this Contagion was ſpread in the Army: For it was preſently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, to have infected the Officers rather than the Common Souldiers, by which King <hi>James</hi> was no leſs deceived than the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> abuſed; for all thoſe Officers that had promiſed the Prince, did withal aſſure him, that they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted the thing with the Men under their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but it proved quite otherwiſe, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by that one Inſtance of <hi>Langſton</hi> when he went over to the Prince, which made the greateſt noiſe of any other Revolt in the Army, and was in effect more than was done by any body elſe, and deſerves more than all the reſt that was done by the Army; yet moſt of my Lord <hi>Cornbury</hi>'s Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, and all my Lord <hi>Oxford</hi>'s Regiment, ſave two Men, came back to King <hi>James,</hi> and made their way with their Swords; And even <hi>Langſtons</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:58538:40"/>Men when they came within the Princes Guards cry'd out they were betray'd, and though they ſtayed, yet it was rather as Priſoners than Friends, till by the Largeſs of a Months Pay they were brought to be of another opinion; Whereby the Prince was no leſs diſappointed in the Inclinations of the Souldiers, than King <hi>James</hi> was deceived in the Fidelity of his Officers: So that the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage was equal to the King and Prince, and their Meaſures alike broke.</p>
            <p>But if all my Lord <hi>Cornbury</hi>'s Dragoons, and every Man in my Lord <hi>Oxford</hi>'s Regiment had gone over, and they as well as <hi>Langſton</hi>'s Men had been as willing to ſtay as the Prince was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, and let the worſt happen that could; yet he knew two thirds of his Army would ſtand by him as long as he would ſtay with them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was their Intereſt to try the chance of War, rather than tamely yeild the Cudgels, by reaſon they could expect very little reſt for the ſoles of their feet, if they could not drive the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> out of <hi>England,</hi> and there would be no tolerable <hi>Medium</hi> betwixt Death and Victory, and therefore if they loſt the day, they would make the Victory coſt the Prince very dear.</p>
            <p>King <hi>James</hi> could not long be deceived in the number of ſuch as Revolted, for tho' Report might multiply them, yet in a few hours he could know the certainty of it: but till he ran away, there was not two thouſand that had gone over to the Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi> And therefore theſe things duly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, it muſt be ſomething of greater moment than the deſertion in his Army that ſtruck ſuch a damp upon his Spirits.</p>
            <pb n="64" facs="tcp:58538:41"/>
            <p>Therefore we did examine (as you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member) how far the declaration of the Nobility and Gentry for the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> effected the Caſe.</p>
            <p>Many things ſeem at a diſtance to be greater than they are, and the noiſe it makes is open more than the thing it ſelf: And without queſtion it was no pleaſant Muſick to King <hi>James</hi> when he heard of any that had declared for the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the opener it was repeated the worſe he liked it; for fame would cry it up to be more than it was, and how much further ſuch News was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, by ſo much would the number be ſwelled of ſuch as declared for the Prince; for every 20 Miles would add a Cypher to the Number, Stories ſeldom looſe in the telling, and thoſe much leſs than any others, and is always helped on by ſuch as are Spectators on ſuch Occaſions, who are not very Curious to take the Numbers exactly, for their Fear or Affection makes them magnifie the thing far beyond what it is; So that it's no wonder if People at a diſtance give ſo much credit to it.</p>
            <p>But that we might underſtand where the ſtreſs of this Matter lay, you may remember we did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh betwixt ſuch as declared for the Prince, and remained upon the place, and ſuch as moved to Joyne the Prince as ſoon as they could get up to him: for though each of them to a great degree did very Conſiderable Service, yet they differ very much in their Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who declared for the Prince, and ſtirred not out of the Country, did notwithſtanding very good Service, and Merit very much for it; For it muſt be very mortifying to King <hi>James</hi> (whoſe Fear had ſo much maſtered his Reaſon) to hear
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:58538:41"/>when any place had declared for the Prince, and the rather becauſe that he who had thought of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than to ride the Nation whip and ſpur, ſhould not only be thrown out of the Saddle, but be kickt at as he was falling, and to ſee thoſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple lift up their Heels againſt him, upon whoſe Necks he thought he did tread; Nay to find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf oppoſed by many of thoſe very People, who by their Addreſſes, and baſe Compliances, had helped him to bridle and ſaddle the Nation. He that ſtarted at Shaddows, and was terrified at every Noiſe, muſt be confounded at the News that in ſuch a place they had declared for the Prince, and being done but in one place, would paſs for the unanimous Conſent of the whole Country, who in a vaſt Body well arm'd and provided, were marching againſt him, and would be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented with all poſſible advantage, and more than with truth it could bear: But this would not be all; for his fear would remind him, that misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes never go ſingle, and therefore this was only the beginning of Sorrow, and that <hi>Job</hi>'s Meſſengers were on the way to bring him more and heavier Tydings than this; That this was the breaking out of a Plague that had infected the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and being deſtitute of any Oblation to make Attonement, he might quickly expect to hear he was beſet on Every ſide.</p>
            <p>But after all this it muſt be confeſſed, on the other hand, that what they did ſeemed much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at firſt ſight, than it would appear upon a ſecond examination, and would neither ſtrike ſuch a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour on King <hi>James,</hi> nor give that incouragement to their Friends as it ſeemed to promiſe; For by lying ſtill they gave King <hi>James</hi> the opportunity
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:58538:42"/>to know their Strength as well as to their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as how they were provided with Arms and other Neceſſaries for the Service; and when upon further enquiry he found they were not ſo formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable as at firſt reported, it would naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline him to give the leſs credit, and be leſs affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Reports that came from other Parts, and conſequently if he had any life left in him, rouſe up his Spirits and take freſh heart.</p>
            <p>Beſides by not moving they did too much diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their fear, both to their Priends and Enemies, and at beſt hand ſhewed they were rather on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive than offenſive part; for it lookt more like Parlying than a Reſolution to fight, and to receive Termes, rather than to give them, and that they expected to be relieved by the Prince, rather than that he might hope for any aſſiſtance from them: for in the North, where the greateſt Show was made of any place ſo remote from the Princes Landing, and the ſecuring of <hi>York</hi> was the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of their Atchievements, their Courage did not out-run their Diſcretion; for they did not adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to name the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> but pretended the contrary to the Duke of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and uſed as much Artifice to delude him as if it had been of the higheſt conſequence to ſecure him, though he was attended by none but thoſe of his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; And there was as much preparation and conſulting in order to ſurprize <hi>York,</hi> as if it had been the moſt conſiderable Garriſon in <hi>England,</hi> though kept only by twenty Men, and they as ready to yeild and declare for the Prince as they could have wiſht: And when they were poſſeſt of the Town, they ſet ſtrict Guards at every place, and ſuffered none to go out or come in, till they
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:58538:42"/>were fatisfied with their buſineſs, and were as wary as if a conſiderable Force had been ready to ſit down before the place: And with the like Steps they moved at <hi>Notingham,</hi> and other places: And though no doubt they ingaged in the buſineſs with a great deal of Zeal and Reſolution, yet the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the cauſe of their Aſſembling, was penn'd with great caution, perhaps as a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Man amongſt them ſaid, to keep themſelves within the Statute; for their Declaration, neither charged King <hi>James</hi> with Male Adminiſtration, nor complained of the danger we were in, but the Sum of it was to joyn with the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> in declaring for a <hi>Free Parliament:</hi> Whereby they put it into King <hi>James</hi> his power to oblige them to put up their Swords as ſoon as he pleaſed; for when ever he iſſued out his Proclamation for a <hi>Free Parliament,</hi> they were bound in Honour to lay down their Arms: And then what very great Service can they boaſt of who could hold their Swords in their hand no longer than King <hi>James</hi> pleaſed? And though they may pretend to Merit highly, yet not to the degree with thoſe who mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved forward to Joyn the Princes Army: For by their Motion they prevented King <hi>James</hi> from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a true Account of their Numbers, and as they would daily increaſe, ſo every Account he had of them would make them ſtill more confide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. They ſhewed thereby, that they were reſolved not to look back, but would either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer or dye. They did not mince the Matter, but ſpoke plain Engliſh of King <hi>James,</hi> and of our Condition, and thereby animated the Country as they Marcht, and made all ſure behind them, ſo that the further they Marcht the greater Service
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:58538:43"/>they did, for 500 Men thus moving would in a ſhort time occaſion 40000 to riſe in Arms; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in a few days they would not only be reported, but in effect be ſo conſiderable and formidable as to ſupport the Cauſe they had eſpouſed, and either reduce King <hi>James</hi> to Meaſures, or drive him out of the Kingdom: So that this ſeems to be the great thing that ſo aſtoniſhed King <hi>James,</hi> and put him to his Wits end. For as to the Princes Forces, their Number was not valuable, and if preſſed very hard would not too obſtinately ſtand it out, becauſe it was evident they had a Retreat in their thoughts, and accordingly had provided for it. The deſertion in his Army he could not much regard, becauſe it did not amount to 2000 Men, till he ran away: But as to thoſe who inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to Joyn with the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> his Army; he would with dread behold the Storm coming upon him, for he might obſerve the Cloud no big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at firſt than a Mans hand, increaſed ſo faſt, that it would quickly over ſpread the whole Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and prove ſo great a weight, that it would bear down all before it; for their Numbers would quickly ſwell very high, and it could not be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, where and at what degree they would ſtop: He might plainly ſee, that they had thrown away the Scabbard, and contemned the thoughts of asking quarter; for as they could never hope for another opportunity to recover their Liberties if they failed in this, ſo they very well knew the inexorable temper of King <hi>James,</hi> that it would be to no great purpoſe to ſue for his Mercy; whereby being made deſperate, and abetted more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over by the whole Nation; he muſt expect the utmoſt that could be done by the united Vigour of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:58538:43"/>Courage, Revenge, the Recovery of Liberty, and Deſpair, all which would make up too ſtrong a Compoſition for King <hi>James</hi> his tender Stomach, and turn his thoughts from fighting, to contrive the beſt way to ſave his Life, and this was the Storm that drove him away from <hi>Salisbury.</hi>

               <hi>Obſervations upon the</hi> Attainder <hi>of the Late Duke of</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth.</head>
            <p>THAT which is done by King, Lords and Commons is ſo Sacred as not to be called in queſtion by any power on Earth, and what they do is ſo very good, that the Wit of Man cannot deviſe any conſtitution that can proceed with more Juſtice, or be leſs ſubject to err than they when rightly in Conjunction: And therefore whoever he be that propoſes to have any of their Acts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewed muſt take care to ſet his words in great order, by reaſon that that which in an Inferiour Court might be called error will ſcarcely indure the ſoft name of a miſtake, if done by King, Lords and Commons: But however it does appear that they have reconſider'd what they have done, and thereupon have many times found that they might do better than to adhere to their firſt reſolve, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in caſes of Bills of Attainder, which for the moſt part have rather been expedient than that the ſtrict Rules of Juſtice were purſued, and though in ſo doing their wrath did ſeem to burn very hot, yet in effect for little more than a moment, and even to end with the blow that ſtruck off the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals Head; for upon the Petition of his Heir, his Blood has ſeldom been deny'd to be reſtored, and this proceeds from the great humanity of this Government. The Law of <hi>England</hi> being a Law of Mercy, does in many Caſes appoint a grievous
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:58538:44"/>puniſhment, rather <hi>in Terrorem</hi> than that the penalty ſhould be rigorouſly exacted; for which reaſon it is that ſo few Attainders are now in force; If then thoſe Caſes have met with ſo much compaſſion, the Caſe of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> may well hope for the like favour, ſince there is not any argument for the reverſing of any other Attainder, that cannot be urg'd with as great force in the caſe of the Duke, and beſides there is no preſident of the like caſe to be found, and whileſt it remains in force is of dangerous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence.</p>
            <p>The Law is ſo very careful to do right in every caſe, that it will not allow that any Man be judg'd without being heard, or at leaſt that a convenient time be allotted him for it, if he think fit to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; and it does alſo require that the fact be fully and ſufficiently proved, without both of which no Man can be convicted of any offence in the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry courſe of Juſtice, and this is and has ever been reputed the undoubted Right and Priviledge of every Subject of <hi>England;</hi> and theſe things are ſo much of the eſſence of Juſtice, that by how much they are infring'd and invaded, by ſo much the juſtice of <hi>England</hi> is the leſs able to ſtand and ſubſiſt.</p>
            <p>Now in the caſe of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> theſe were not only diſpenſed with, but the uſual Method of proceeding upon Bills in Parliament was not obſerv'd, for in one and the ſame day, that Bill of Attainder was begun and paſſed both Houſes. That the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was then Landed and in Arms was currant News at that time, and believed by every Body: But the queſtion is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Two Houſes of Parliament were infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:58538:45"/>of it in due manner, and with the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Legal Evidence; for it's a very different and quite another thing both as to form and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, what may ſatisfie a Man in his private Judgment, and what is ſufficient to guide and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him in point of Law and Juſtice, ſince that which might perſwade one as a Spectator to believe the Priſoner guilty of the Crime with which he ſtands charg'd, may not in any ſort be evidence to find him guilty, if he were one of his Jury.</p>
            <p>For put the caſe, a Man is accuſed of Treaſon or Felony before a proper Magiſtrate, and the Perſons who afterwards happen to be his Jury, are preſent at his Examination, and the Fact is not only point blank proved, but the Party Accuſed confeſſes it: Yet when he ſtands upon his Tryal, unleſs he do there again confeſs the Indictment, or the Fact be proved by ſufficient Evidence, the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry muſt acquit him.</p>
            <p>Or thus, If a Man is Indicted for Treaſon or Felony, though Twenty, or a greater number of Men, of undoubted Credit and Probity ſhould declare upon their Words and Reputation, nay, with great aſſeverations and Imprecations, that they knew the Indictment to be true, yet if nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they nor any Body elſe will ſwear to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment, the Jury muſt find for the Priſoner; and yet thoſe Men ſo ſeriouſly and folemnly declaring themſelves would ſufficiently ſatisfie all By Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and even the Jury too as to their private Judgments: But their Teſtimony not being ſuch as the Law calls Legal Evidence, it cannot affect the Priſoner.</p>
            <p>In caſe of Treaſon the Law requires Two Witneſſes, who muſt be of good Reputation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:58538:45"/>to the Priſoner, and their Evidence is to be clear and direct to the Fact, and void of all implication; for if they are Men of Evil Fame, have Malice to the Priſoner, or are Bribed, Swear doubtfully, either as to the Time, place, or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the thing; any of theſe renders their Teſtimony invalid.</p>
            <p>It is granted, That from any thing in the Act of Attainder it cannot be objected, That the Two Houſes had not before them ſufficient and Legal Evidence of the Dukes being then in open Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, it being needleſs to expreſs it, becauſe they are ſuppoſed not to proceed without it; But it is notorious that all the Evidence they were then poſſeſt of, was a Letter ſent to King <hi>James</hi> in the Name of the Mayor of <hi>Lyme,</hi> and a Printed De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration under the Name of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Letter of the Mayor of <hi>Lyme,</hi> Firſt there was no proof who wrote it. Secondly, The Letter declared him that wrote it to be in great diſorder at the inſtant of writing it. Thirdly, It gave an account of not above Sixty Perſons that were come on Shoar with the Duke. And Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That upon their approach he fled out of Town, and believed that by that time, his Houſe and moſt of the Town was pillag'd and ranſack't.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſuch uncertainties as would render it inſufficient to be Evidence in a much leſs caſe, for it being not proved, who wrote it, it might in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Law, be rather look't upon as his that deliver'd it, than to be ſent by Mr. Mayor: But had it been proved to be his; yet the diſorder he own'd he was in renders the purport of his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of very little credit; or if he had been more
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58538:46"/>compoſed, the coming of Sixty Perſons only into the Town, was no great indication of their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtility, having not offer'd violence to any Body, or if they had been a far greater number, yet for ought he knew they were retir'd to their Ships, and gone away, becauſe he ran out of Town up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their approach. Beſides this there was nothing expreſs'd in the Letter; wherefore he did believe, that ſuch diſorders were then committed in the Town; for he neither ſaw, nor heard of any Man that had receiv'd the leaſt injury whileſt he ſtay'd, nor had the Duke then declared for what intent he came. The people of the place might perhaps flock to ſee the Duke, yet that could be no Evidence of an intended outrage, it being no new thing in <hi>England</hi> for the People to crow'd together, when an Eminent Perſon is to be ſeen, and eſpecially on account of the Duke. Beſides, as his Diſpoſition did make him averſe to commit any inhumanity, ſuch as was ſuggeſted by the Letter, ſo in point of prudence it highly beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him to treat the place as obligingly as was poſſible, for it had been the falſeſt ſtep imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to have done the leaſt violence to any body: So that this part of the Letter deſtroys the Credit, which the reſt of it might otherwiſe have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd: And take it altogether is ſo weak and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous, that a Letter found in the Streets would amount to as good Evidence in any caſe as this could; for at beſt hand it could not be of greater weight than to corroborate a Legal Evidence. To allow a Paper ſtanding alone to be good evidence cannot be ſafe; and muſt be very dangerous if ſuch as this may paſs, becauſe that evidence will not be wanting, when a turn is to be ſerv'd.</p>
            <pb n="75" facs="tcp:58538:46"/>
            <p>As to the Printed Declaration, It paſſed indeed under the Dukes Name, but there was no proof, that he drew it, approv'd it, order'd it to be Printed or Diſpers'd, or that he ever ſaw it, or was privy to it. It was read in the Houſe of Lords by the Kings Command, or elſe it had been a ſecret to them, as well as to the World, that there was ſuch a thing; for as that was the firſt time that it was heard of, ſo not any more of thoſe Prints came publickly abroad, and not one Man of a Million that either ſaw or heard the Contents of that Print; and for that reaſon, it's not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether improbable, but that that Declaration was a Contrivance of the Court, and ſhamm'd upon the Duke of <hi>Monmouth.</hi> But to let that paſs, That which makes a Man guilty of Treaſon or any other Crime is his Privity or Conſent to it, and that not being proved, it could no more render the Duke Criminal of that Declaration, than it could him that caſually heard it read: For if the Printing of a Treaſonable Paper in a Mans Name, will make him anſwerable for it, then no Man can be ſafe longer than he is out of the thoughts of his Enemies, or they are not arrived to that pitch of Villany as knowingly to deſtroy an Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Man.</p>
            <p>Take then theſe things together, and ſee how precariouſly every Man holds his Life and Honour, if ſuch things as they (I mean the Mayors Letter and Printed Declaration) may paſs for Evidence, for what can then be more eaſie than to ſham any Man out of his Life, and all that is dear to him.</p>
            <p>But had the Evidence been as full and as clear as it could, or ought to be in ſuch Caſes, yet it is of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58538:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Eſſence of the Juſtice of <hi>England,</hi> that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty accus'd ſhould be heard, or have ſufficient time aſſign'd him, ſo as that it muſt be his own fault, if he do not appear and make his defence. This is the Law not only of this, but in all Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions where the Government is not Deſpotick or Arbitrary. For there cannot be a greater Badge of Slavery, than that Men may be condemn'd without being heard to their Accuſation: In the time of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. <hi>Cromwell</hi> Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> being then a great Man, and out of deſign to deſtroy ſome, whom he knew not well how to ruine otherways; contrived and promoted a Law for a Summary way of Tryal, ſo as that a Man might be judg'd without being heard; but as it fell out he periſhed by the Snare that he had layd for others, for he was condemn'd without being heard to his charge, and he was the only Man that was toucht by that Law, for his caſe made it ſo odious, that immediately upon it, it was repealed, as being unjuſt, and inconſiſtent with the Juſtice of this Government.</p>
            <p>God the Righteous Judge of all the Earth, though he knows what we can ſay in our defence, will hear us before he condemns us, for otherwiſe his Sentence would not appear to be juſt. The Law in caſe of Blood proceeds by ſlow ſteps, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Blood when ſpilt cannot be gathered up again; for it is a Maxime in our Law, that no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay is too great when Life is concern'd; the Law deſires that every Man ſhould prove innocent, and does ſuppoſe he is ſo till he is found to be otherways by his Peers, and for that reaſon it is that a Judge may not give the Priſoner at the Bar reproachful Language, till the Jury has found
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58538:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>him guilty, and then too he is not to be condemn'd, till he has moved in Arreſt of Judgment, and heard what he can further ſay for himſelf.</p>
            <p>To hear a Cauſe <hi>ex parte</hi> is in effect to know nothing of the Truth, ſo as to be able to make a Judgment where the Right is. Many Innocent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons will unavoidably ſuffer, when ever it comes to be Law that Men may be try'd and condemn'd, without being heard: This ſort of Juſtice will ſet the Innocent and Guilty on the ſame foot; and to throw Croſs and Pile, whether the Priſoner ſhall be acquitted or condemn'd is as Juſt, as to Try a Man without hearing his Defence.</p>
            <p>Now it's undeniable that there was no time given by the Bill for the Duke to appear, which muſt at beſt hand be allow'd to be a great omiſſion; for in all other Acts of Attainder, if the Perſon was alive, a convenient time was allowed him to come and be heard, and till that time was expired, the Act was not in force againſt him, nor could the penalty therein expreſt affect him in the leaſt.</p>
            <p>But beſide theſe things, there fell out ſome thing further in this Bill of Attainder, that is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual and extraordinary; for it was begun and paſs'd both Houſes, in one and the ſame day, which was never heard of before in any caſe, though the occaſion were never ſo preſſing: The Method of paſſing all Bills being quite otherways. For when a Bill is brought into either Houſe of Parliament, or ſent from one Houſe to the other, it is not often that they give it a reading the ſame day, or if they do, it's ſeldom that a Bill is read above once in one day, and when it has been read a ſecond time, if it be not rejected it is committed, and then for the more part the Committee does proceed upon
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:58538:48"/>it ſome other day, and not upon that, ſo that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly no Bill can paſs either Houſe in leſs than Three days: And this gradual way of proceeding upon Bills, demonſtrates the great Wiſdom and Juſtice of the Two Houſes, and vindicates them againſt precipitancy and partiality. This has been the Ancient and Approved Method beyond the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of Man or Records, and it has ever been found ſafe if not fatal to go out of the path of our Fore-fathers.</p>
            <p>And thus ſtands the Caſe as to the paſſing of the Bill of Attainder againſt the D. of <hi>Monmouth;</hi> which muſt be acknowledg'd to be a Summary way of proceeding upon preſumption, without Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Evidence, or hearing the Party, or obſerving the uſual Method of paſſing Bills in Parliament.</p>
            <p>But it is objected and ſaid in the defence of this, That the Legiſlature of <hi>England</hi> is confined to no Rules and Directions, but that of their diſcretion, and that upon ſuddain emergencies, when it will be to the Publick Detriment to ſtay for the ordinary and uſual Forms of Law they may juſtifie the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſing with them; and for that reaſon all that was done in the Duke of <hi>Monmouths</hi> caſe is very well warranted, becauſe there was then <hi>flagrante bello.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true that the Parliament has ſuch a diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary Power, and it's reaſonable it ſhould be ſo; but yet this does not prove that a more deliberate proceeding might not have been had upon that Bill, however it will ſcarcely afford an Argument, wherefore the Attainder ſhould not now be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers'd, but rather that it ought to be, becauſe when the Miſchief is prevented, that induced the Parliament to ſuch an extraordinary courſe, it
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58538:48"/>was the conſtant practice of our Fore-fathers to put it out of ſight as ſoon as could be. And nothing could be more prudent, for ſo long as it remain'd a precedent, it might be the occaſion of a greater evil than it had prevented; and ſo long as this Attainder ſtands in force, it will be look't upon as an Expoſition of the Law, declaring that it may be Legal and Juſt to condemn without Evidence, or hearing the Parties defence, and thereby put our Lives and Families into a more precarious condition, when in the diſcretion of the Two Houſes of Parliament, then when they are to be judged in the Inferiour Courts of Juſtice; and ſo chalk out a Method for unfortunate Times, to take off any Man that ſtands in the way, for though what was done in this caſe may be ſaid to be <hi>Jus,</hi> yet it was <hi>Summum Jus,</hi> and if it was <hi>Juſtum,</hi> yet it was not done <hi>Juſtè.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But over and above all this, there happen'd a thing in purſuance of this Bill, which though in ſtrictneſs of Law it cannot be aſſign'd as ſufficient Error, yet in reaſon may be an inducement to the Parliament to reverſe this Attainder.</p>
            <p>The Life of every Man is under the protection of the Law, even Perſons Condemned, Outlawed, or Attainted, to Kill or Execute them in any other manner than the Law directs is Criminal: In caſe of Outlawry for Treaſon or Felony in the Kings Bench, if the Party be apprehended in time of a Vacation, no Warrant can go out to execute him before the next Term, but he is till then to remain in Priſon, that ſo he may not only be heard what he can ſay for himſelf, wherefore Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution ſhould not be awarded, but that alſo the Law may be ſatisfied, that he is the very Perſon
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:58538:49"/>named in the Outlawry, and even a Priſoner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd at the Bar cannot be executed till there is a Rule of Court, or other order for it: Now it is conceived that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> ought not to have been executed till he had been brought before the King's Bench, or ſome other Court that could properly judge and diſtinguiſh, whether he were the very Perſon Attainted by that Act; for had he been brought to the Bar, and there deny'd that he was the ſame Perſon, a Jury muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon have been impanelled to try whether he were the proper Perſon or not: For the Law delights in certainty, and will not go out of ſo grave and conſiderate a way, eſpecially in ſo ſolemn a caſe as Blood, where it cannot be too cautious; one Man may be ſo like another, that it is not eaſie to diſtinguiſh them when aſunder, and a miſtake in ſuch a kind would be a great blot upon the Juſtice of any Government, when it is occaſion'd by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitancy and haſte; but we have lately ſeen ſuch unfortunate times, when there was a willing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to commit ſuch Miſtakes, if any Colour of Law could have been found for it.</p>
            <p>But ſetting all theſe things aſide, and were there not ſo many extraordinary things in the Caſe, yet ſomething ought to be done for the ſake of the Dukes Children; ſurely a great deal of compaſſion is due to them, conſidering upon what ſcore their Father loſt his Head; by reaſon that the Cauſe of his Riſing in Arms was no other than that which prevailed with the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> to make a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent into <hi>England,</hi> that is to deliver us from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and Slavery; there being nothing that diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences thoſe two Caſes, but that the one had ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and the other miſcarried, and therefore can
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:58538:49"/>it be politick to leave that Attainder unrevers'd as a reproach upon the Duke and his Poſterity for what he did.</p>
            <p>Beſides, if this Attainder be not revers'd, it will be an utter diſcouragement upon all others for the future to attempt the reſcue of their Country, if no regard ſhall be had to their Poſterity, in caſe they don't ſucceed: I am verily perſwaded that if the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had miſcarried in his late Attempt to deliver us, every Man that had ſuffered in that cauſe, would have expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that when ever it was in the power of the Nation, to have had a mark of favour be ſet upon their Poſterity, at leaſt that of right their Families were to be put in <hi>Statu quo:</hi> There will be very ſmall inducement for any to be concern'd for the Publick, when nothing but ſucceſs will make the Publick take care of them; when the Vertue of a People is ſo far depraved as to forget thoſe that have ſerv'd them; they do not after that long retain a true ſenſe of Liberty, and are eaſily perſwaded to part with their freedom; and ſo long as this Attainder remains in force, it hangs over the Nation like a dreadful <hi>Omen;</hi> for ſo long as it is in force we conſent to the Juſtice of it, and how can that be Juſt which we would not have done to our ſelves; for certainly no Man would like to be Judged by ſuch Law as took off the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and therefore what can be ſaid that his Attainder ſhould not be revers'd?</p>

            <head>THE INTEREST OF Whigg and Tory.</head>
            <head type="sub">A LETTER to a Friend.</head>
            <p>THough others may be more fortunate in their Conceptions, yet I am confident that no Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy imploys their thoughts ſo often, and with more Affection to His Majeſties Service than I do: It is very obvious that the Kings Affairs are much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd: Vaſt ſupplys are neceſſary, and there is but a dark proſpect where the Money will be had, or if the Nation were in more Wealthy Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, the Diviſions that are amongſt us would much obſtruct the giving ſo much as is needful at this time: But the greateſt difficulty which the King has to ſtruggle with will be from the High Church or Tory Party, and the more he truſts or confides in them, the harder game he will have to play: For give me leave to ſay the King can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſafe in depending upon them till they change their Principles, or he do foregoe his own: No Man can have ſo mean a thought of the King that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:58538:50"/>he will ever have ſo little Honour or Juſtice either to deny or go counter to what he has profeſs'd and practiſed in the whole courſe of his Life: And it's very plain that it is Private Intereſt, and not the Publick good, is the Principle by which that party has been acted: And though they have ſometimes ſeemed very zealous to ſerve the Crown, yet they have never gone further with any King than ſo long as they could ſerve themſelves of him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unleſs they are govern'd by a more Publick Principle, or have given more ample teſtimonies of their true affection to the King, than they have done to thoſe that have been before him, the more Countenance he gives them, the more he ſtrengthens the hands that will be lift up againſt him, if a fair occaſion offer it ſelf. The Seven Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops who were ſent to the Tower for refuſing to read K. <hi>James</hi>'s Declaration, were highly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded for that Action, as a Service done the Publick, but if their own particular Intereſt had not prevailed with them, they would not have been ſo forward, to read the Declaration of K.C. that ſtruck more directly at the heart of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and reproach all that ſhew'd a diſlike of it. If that Party has given any inſtances of their Affection to this King, either they are not publickly known, or not well underſtood, but what they have done on the contrary are too notorious to admit of a Diſpute: It was that Party that conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſo obſtinately for the Regency, and when the matter came to be decided by a Vote in the Houſe of Lords, there was but one Biſhop that gave his Vote againſt the Regency Who are they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe of that Party and the Papiſts that at this day refuſe to take the Oaths, Five of the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:58538:51"/>Seven Biſhops have ſo done. It was that Party in the Houſe of Lords that oppoſed the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Oaths with the penalty eſpecially on the Clergy: It's that Party that ſo much favours the Papiſts of this day; and if any Proteſtants are found to be in a Plot with the Papiſts, they are all of that Party: Every thing moved in Parliament for our ſettlement receives its oppoſition from that Party, and I do averr that amongſt that Party there are none of them who have been preferred by the King have given a Vote, but have oppoſed every thing that was for the Publick good: Whatever tends to recal K. <hi>James,</hi> or to facilitate his read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, is vigorouſly diſputed for by that Party: And tho' they now ſtand ſo ſtifly for his Intereſt, yet they paſſively lookt on whilſt he was driven out of this Kingdom, which is an undeniable Argument that they either wanted Courage or Intereſt, and a defect in either of them makes them rather to be deſpiſed, than fear'd; for if they had neither Courage nor Intereſt to ſerve K. <hi>James,</hi> in whom they have ſo much inclination, it will not much mend the matter when this King is in the ſame Caſe. They have not the face to juſtifie the late Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Proceedings, yet are very buſie to keep in, and get into Imployments the very Perſons that were then made uſe of. I don't deſire that theſe People ſhould be removed to make more room for me, for I am very well ſatisfied with the Poſt I am in, and with all poſſble thankfulneſs acknowledge his Majeſties Grace and Favour, but I ſay this, becauſe I wiſh that every Man the King makes uſe of, were altogether as honeſt and affectionate to his Service as I am, and as able to ſerve him as I am willing.</p>
            <pb n="85" facs="tcp:58538:51"/>
            <p>I was and am of opinion that the King made a very wrong ſtep when he employed ſo many of that Party, becauſe it would unavoidably abate the Zeal of many of his Friends, and I fear it has had this further bad effect, to make thoſe People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that either he is afraid of them, or that they are neceſſary to him; whoſe utmoſt hopes or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations were to ſhroud themſelves under an Act of Oblivion</p>
            <p>I am far from reflecting upon what the King has done, for it lyes heavy upon my Spirits as oft as I think of it, but I ſhould rejoyce if I could offer any thing to help the King to make the beſt of a bad bargain: For he has a very tickliſh game in his hands: If he ſhould now all at once diſcard that Party, no doubt it would confound his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs very much for the preſent, and on the other hand, if he do not ſo carry it towards Friends (till with more convenience he may put them off) that they may ſee it is neceſſity and not choice that makes him take this courſe, he will be in great danger of looſing moſt, if not all of them, and if ſo the King will be in very untoward Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: For then he will be under the neceſſity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending wholly upon this Party, and conſequently he muſt run up to all the exceſs that they have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly practiſed, and yet he ſhall not be ſure of them, for as ſoon as they can make a better bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, they'l leave him to ſhift for himſelf: This I conceive to be the Kings Caſe, and I wiſh any thing could be thought on that would do his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs effectually.</p>
            <p>I do highly approve the Kings Method relating to Eccleſiaſtical matters in giving of the Church Preferments to none but Moderate Men, and of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:58538:52"/>Exemplary Lives; for hereby the fierceneſs of the High Church-Men will be abated, and the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niceneſs of the Diſſenters taken off, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently bring both ſides to better temper, which is the firſt and principal ſtep in order to uniting of Proteſtants.</p>
            <p>In like manner, if the King would for the future, diſpoſe of all ſuch places as become vacant to none but Moderate Men, and eſpecially give the preference to ſuch as deſerv'd well of him, this would be to the ſatisfaction of his Friends, and could give no cauſe of offence to the contrary Party; it would let his friends ſee what further kindneſs he intended them, and the other would have no cauſe to complain; or if they did, they would looſe ground by it: And further to diſplace ſuch as in Parliament Vote againſt the Intereſt of the King and Kingdom, I think cannot be a queſtion; I am far from thinking it to be juſtifiable to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place Men for Voting according to their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but when Men are for promoting of that which is againſt the Publick, or for bringing in K <hi>James,</hi> or bringing on Confuſion, to continue ſuch in Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment muſt diſcourage the Kings Friends, and to put them out can offend none but ſuch as whoſe good or ill will is equally to be regarded.</p>
            <p>Beſides the preſent juncture of Affairs, there ſeems to be but one objection againſt turning out theſe ſort of Men immediately, and that is the doubt in what Intereſt the bulk of <hi>England</hi> lies: This is a thing that may certainly be known, but it would be a great deal more than this Paper can allow of to make it clearly out; and yet I will humbly offer one thing that will in a few words give a great deal of light into it, That when we
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:58538:52"/>have had two State Officers in the ſame ſtation of different Parties it's reaſonable to ſuppoſe that all Perſons that have buſineſs will apply themſelves to the one or the other according to the Intereſt they are of, if then it ſhall fall out that he who eſpouſes the true Intereſt of his Country has three times the buſineſs of the other, I conceive it no mean Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument where the weight of <hi>England</hi> is.</p>
            <p>Much more I could ſay upon this Subject, and I fear I have already exceeded the bounds of a Letter: Yet if what I have ſaid is worth your pains of reading, there is no Body to whom I can with ſo much ſatisfaction communicate my Thoughts, nor will better improve any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that may be made by it than your ſelf: But if I have not ſaid much to the purpoſe, I hope the honeſty of my Inclination will obtain your pardon, and continue me the honour of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>UPon the late Declaration of <hi>Indulgence,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny having abſented themſelves from the Church, our high Church-men have from hence taken occaſion to lay it down as a <hi>Maxime,</hi> That if <hi>Popery</hi> be Eſtabliſht here in <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> are the only cauſe and occaſion of it, and by the Thunder and Noiſe that they make in their Pulpits, and all other places, a great many others are perſwaded to be of their opinion; yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not aſſent to it, though I am far from turning Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, either for the Declaration, or thoſe that make uſe of it, yet as a moderate and juſt Man I would ſet the Saddle on the right Horſe, and I am perſwaded that any impartial conſidering Man will when he thinks on it ſeriouſly, find, That it is by the help not ſo much of the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> as the high Church, that <hi>Popery</hi> has put foot into the Stirrup, and is ready to mount into the Saddle: But yet I hope that on which of them ſoever <hi>Popery</hi> ſhall moſt depend, when it is raiſing it ſelf to the pitch that it deſigns, that they will ſlip away its hold, and thereby make that the occaſion of its ruine, that was deſigned for its eſtabliſhment.</p>
            <pb n="89" facs="tcp:58538:53"/>
            <p>It muſt be confeſt that the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> when they had the upper hand, did not behave themſelves with the utmoſt moderation towards others that differed from them, but yet our high Church men can never anſwer either as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> or Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, the procuring of ſuch ſevere Laws as were made at the late Kings Reſtauration, and the puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them too with ſo much violence upon the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> if many times thoſe Laws were not ſtretcht and extended beyond their true meaning and natural conſtruction: And with ſuch fury did they carry on their Revenge, that had they been told, they knew not of what Spirit they were, they would not have borne ſo gentle a Reproof with any ſort of patience; whilſt in the mean time, they treated the <hi>Papiſts</hi> rather as Friends than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; neither did they ſlack their furious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, till they found the Houſe was ready to fall about their Ears, and ſo were neceſſitated to adjourne their Proceedings till they could be at better leiſure. And as this was very pleaſing to the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> ſo it was no leſs an acceptable piece of Service, to make the terms of Communion ſo ſtrict and ſtrait-laced, and to ſet the Church upon ſo narrow a foundation, that it was impoſſible for it to ſtand upright very long, but muſt in a ſhort time incline to one hand or another, if not fall flat to the ground. Not to mention every thing, but only to give a few Inſtances, and thoſe not the greateſt nor moſt material neither; Firſt then the ſo frequent varying and altering the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of Worſhip, which muſt unavoidably di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract people, and cool their fervency in devotion; Next the turning to the Eaſt when the <hi>Creed</hi> is ſaid, and reading the Scripture and Prayers in ſeveral
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:58538:54"/>parts of the Church, or place of Worſhip, as is now practiſed in our <hi>Cathedrals,</hi> which is to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that God is not equally preſent in all parts of the place, where people are met together to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him, or that he will hear and accept this Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in that place, or that Prayer in another; Then farther the Tautologies, Repetitions, and ſaying the ſame thing over and over in the <hi>Common Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> which is that our Saviour reproved in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion of the <hi>Phariſees;</hi> and beſides the requiring us to ſit when the Second Leſſon is read, and to ſtand up at the Goſpel, though they happen to be the ſelf-ſame part of Scripture; which is nothing leſs than to injoyn a contradiction. Theſe things and many others, though they pretended they are indifferent, and required only for order and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, yet did they exact the obſervance of them much more than other things that are requiſite to make a Man a good Chriſtian: So that though theſe things may not be ſuperſtitious in themſelves, yet to require ſuch an exact obſervance of them muſt be introductive of Superſtition; And they had laid ſuch a Foundation, as on which the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> did propoſe to build ſurely and ſubſtantially, eſpecially when the high Church men were raiſing a Superſtructure upon it by the arbitrary Doctrines which they gave out in the Pulpits, and in all other Diſcourſes; in which they aſſerted the Divinity of Kings, ſetting him no other bounds to his Power but what his Will ſhould preſcribe; together with the Doctrine of <hi>Non-reſiſtance,</hi> and to extend it even to our thoughts; and whoever would not ſubſcribe their aſſent and conſent to theſe things, they would write upon their back, <hi>Traditur Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolo,</hi> and aſſign them Hell and Damnation for their
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58538:54"/>portion, no leſs than if they had denied the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Chriſtian Faith; but beſides, when they declared that they would rather be <hi>Papiſts</hi> than <hi>Presbyterians;</hi> the <hi>Papiſts</hi> did hope that they ſhould have little more to do, in bringing their work to perfection, than to ſit by, and direct what they would have done: eſpecially when they ſaw the high Church-men contend ſo furiouſly for the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion as if their All had depended upon it, as well as it was the only hopes the <hi>Papiſts</hi> had left them; who were further confirmed in their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations, when upon the diſcovery of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Plot by <hi>Oats,</hi> theſe Church-men became Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates for it, and with ſo much Zeal and Induſtry endeavourd to leſſen and take off the credit of the Diſcovery; and yet no ſooner was an Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that ſort brought againſt the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> but they undertook to demonſtrate the clearneſs of it, though moſt other people lookt upon it as a ſham, and peice of Forgery of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance, to take off the <hi>Odium</hi> of their own Plot that was a true one; but however theſe Church-men, as if they hoped hereby to make their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, had nothing in their Mouths but blood and ſlaughter, bawling out for full and ſpeedy Juſtice againſt all thoſe whoſe Names were mentioned in that Plot, ſcarcely allowing them that play for their lives which the Law gives to every Subject; and condemning in their Judgments every one before he had received his Trial, and being out of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence if any one was acquitted: And many of theſe Men lookt upon the <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> Act as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous Law, becauſe it helped ſeveral to their liberty who were clapt up, though nothing could be charged upon them. Thus did they proceed
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58538:55"/>to the ſatisfaction of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> till the King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puffed up with his Succeſs againſt the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> he <hi>clapt ſpurs to them</hi> to make them mend their rate, whereby he ran them out of breath, and then inſtead of going on they fell to kicking at him; for now they can preach againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> and don't ſtick to ſay it openly, that the King has not kept his word, and indeed ſpeak of him and his Government in ſawcy and unmannerly Language, and let fall ſuch words againſt his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, as they would heretofore have called Seditious, had they come out of other peoples mouths; yet now they reckon themſelves the only Champions againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> and the chief Supports of the Laws and Liberties, becauſe they ſay and do thoſe things in ten times a greater degree, for which they uſed to call others, diſaffected, and thereby greedily lick up their own Vomit: They wonder now that any do abſent themſelves from the Church, and ſay, if <hi>Popery</hi> do come in, the fault will wholly lie at their Doors, who at this time ſeparate from the Church.</p>
            <p>But ſoft and fair, they make too much haſte; for the blame will not wholly reſt with the <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi> for neither have they yet approved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſuch worthy Patriots: If they are ruined their blood is upon their own heads, and they muſt thank themſelves for it. Though the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are to blame, yet to lay all the fault at their Door, it may as well be ſaid, which is ridiculous to affirm, that he has as great a ſhare in building a Houſe that lays here and there a Stone, as he that lays the Foundation, and raiſes much of the Superſtructure upon it; which is the very Caſe betwixt the high Church-men and the <hi>Diſſenters;</hi> and though our
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:58538:55"/>high Church ſnarle at the King, and treat him with over-familiar Language, yet what they have ſaid and done does not ſo much denote their repentance, as that they are diſobliged and diſappointed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not accompanied with amendment of life, which is the trueſt ſign of penitence; for I doubt, there are very few of them that can boaſt, that they are leſs debaucht and profane: If the matter then be ſo, and they on their part have not done any thing to invite or incourage the <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> to come to Church, they ſhould be the leaſt of all Men that ſhould complain of their abſenting. Upon the whole Matter then, The <hi>Diſſenters</hi> by falling in with the <hi>Indulgence,</hi> have done that which in the conſequence will ſet up Arbitrary Power; But the high Church-men have in expreſs terms preached up and aſſiſted Arbitrary Power, and have treated the <hi>Papiſts</hi> as their Friends: So that they having been chiefly inſtrumental and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Foundation for <hi>Popery</hi> and Slavery, I may without pretending to the gift of Prophecy, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to ſay, that whenever it comes to extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity the greateſt brunt will light upon them, and their Heads will ſheild the blows from others who uſed all lawful means to have prevented the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheif that is coming on apace. Thus I have laid open the Fault on all ſides; let then the high Church be more charitable, and the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> leſs ſtiff and ſweamiſh, and let every one indeavour to live like People profeſſing the Goſpel, and I hope that God may yet have mercy upon this poor Nation.</p>

            <p>I Wiſh I could have been ſilent, and I wiſh there had not been an occaſion for this dayes debate: but ſince we are brought into this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it behoves every Man to put to his Shoulder to ſupport this tottering Nation: And in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that is now before us we ought to conſider ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, for a great deal depends upon it, and therefore I hope that every Gentleman will ſpeak and Vote as God ſhall put it into his heart, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any prejudice or pre-poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>A Bill to Exclude all <hi>Papiſts</hi> from the Crown will produce a great many Inconveniences on both hands, becauſe his R. H. being a <hi>Papiſt</hi> it will ſet him aſide: therefore we are to conſider which is the leſſer evil, and to chooſe that.</p>
            <p>If the D. be excluded, you are told how unjuſt it is to take away his Right from him: that the Crown is his Inheritance if he ſurvive the K. and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:58538:57"/>beſides you provoke him and all the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in <hi>England</hi> to Riſe and cut our Throats.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, it's plain, that when we ſhall have a <hi>Popiſh</hi> K. our Religion and Laws are not ſecure one Moment, but are in continual danger.</p>
            <p>So that the caſe in ſhort is this: Whether we ſhall ſit ſtill and put it to the venture of having a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Succeſſor, then we muſt either ſubmit our Heads to the Block, or fight and be Rebels: Or elſe to have a Law that will juſtifie us in the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our Religion and Laws: In plain Engliſh, whether we would fight for or againſt the Law. I think I have put it right; and now let every Man make his choice, that loves either his God or his Countrey.</p>
            <p>As to the D's Right to the Crown; I wiſh it were clearly known what ſort of Right it is he claims, and whence he derives it: He is not Heir Apparent, neither do I think that our Law knows any ſuch thing as an Heir to the Crown, but only as a Succeſſor: And therefore the D. nor any other whatever, can pretend the ſame Title to the Crown, as the Son of a Subject can to his Fathers Eſtate after his deceaſe; for with Subjects they do not ſucceed but inherit. It is not ſo as to the Crown, for there they ſucceed: And it is from a not rightly conſidering the word <hi>Heir,</hi> as it is a Synonymous term with that of <hi>Succeſſor,</hi> that has made ſo many to be deceived in the D's Title to the Crown: for this word <hi>Heir to the Crown</hi> was not heard of till Arbitrary Power began to put forth. Before <hi>William the Conquerour</hi>'s Time it would have been a ſenſeleſs word, when the people ſet up and pulled down as they ſaw cauſe: And till
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:58538:58"/>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> it was not much in faſhion, when the Crown was ſo frequently ſetled by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and the Next of blood ſo often ſet aſide; when the Son ſeldom followed his Father into the Throne, but either by Election in the Life-time of his Father, or elſe by Act of Parliament. So that to make the D. either Heir Apparent or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive to the Crown, it muſt be proved either by the Conſtitution of the Government, or by ſome Law or Act of Parliament. If therefore he has a Title to the Crown, it's neceſſary to know what it is, and whence he has it; but if he has none, it's not unjuſt to paſs the <hi>Bill,</hi> or any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where he ſhall be particularly named: But I will ſay no more of this, leaſt I may ſeem to be againſt Kingly Government, which I am not.</p>
            <p>If the D. be Excluded becauſe he is a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> yet it is no injuſtice: Why will he be of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that the Law endeavours to ſuppreſs? The Subjects who are of that Religion, forfeit Two parts in Three of their Eſtates, and ſhall any Subject by reaſon of his Quality be exempted from the Law? I hope not; Beſides, if a Subject forfeit two parts, it's reaſonable that the next of blood, or any that is of that Religion, ſhould be excluded from the Crown: becauſe the Law has prohibited all <hi>Papiſts</hi> from having any Office Civil or Military, becauſe their Principles are inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the Government; and then how prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous would it be to make him the Head of the Church, and the Preſerver of our Laws and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, whoſe Religion obliges him to ruine and deſtroy both? So that if the D. had not by his practices given us juſt cauſe to except againſt him, yet barely as he is a <hi>Papiſt</hi> he ought to be Exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:58538:58"/>But when it is conſidered that he has held a correſpondency with the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King, to ſubvert our Religion and Laws, what prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction can we expect from him if he be King? It is a ſenſleleſs thing to imagine, that he will not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb us in our Religion and Laws, ſeeing whileſt he is a Subject he is practiſing to deſtroy us and them: Therefore for my part, I think we betray both our Religion and Laws if we do not paſs this <hi>Bill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is one Opinion which prevails much in the World, which as it is falſe ſo it does a great deal of hurt, and that is this; That every Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the World was conſtituted by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: But that cannot be ſo; for it would follow, that God is unjuſt, which he cannot be. There neither is nor was any Government of that ſort but only that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> the reſt of the World were left to themſelves, to frame ſuch a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as ſuited beſt to their Inclinations, and to make ſuch Rules and Laws as they could beſt obey and be governed by.</p>
            <p>Ours is compounded of an abſolute Monarchy and a Common-wealth, and the original of it we have from the <hi>Saxons:</hi> But be it what it will, or whence it will, it is without queſtion that the firſt original of our Kings was, that the people found it for their advantage to ſet one over them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his Wiſdom, Valour, and Juſtice, and therefore they gave him ſeveral Prerogatives above the reſt of the People, that he might be the better able to govern and defend them: for there is none of the Kings Prerogatives, but are for the good of the Nation if rightly imployed: But it will be a ſtrange concluſion to ſuppoſe, that the People
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:58538:59"/>obliged themſelves to ſubmit to the Poſterity of that Man whom they firſt choſe for their King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his extraordinary Endowments, let them be what they would, and never ſo unfit for the Government: For the next of blood may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of governing in ſeveral reſpects; ſuppoſe a Fool or Lunatick; by his Principles if he aim at Arbitrary Power, by his Religion if he be a <hi>Papiſt</hi> or a <hi>Heathen,</hi> or by his practiſes, before he comes to the Crown, to deſtroy the Religion and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Law Eſtabliſht.</p>
            <p>Now this I do not ſay to argue that the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the King is in the People, though I think much might be ſaid in that caſe, neither is it now the queſtion; but that which I ſpeak for is, to prove that the next of blood has not ſo abſolute an Inherent Right to the Crown, but that he may for the good of the Nation be ſet aſide.</p>
            <p>There is yet another Inconvenience to allow the next of blood to have ſo abſolute a Right to the Crown, becauſe the Poſſeſſion of the Crown takes away all diſabilities, but only ſuch as are by Act of Parliament; which being ſo, every King muſt thank his Succeſſor for every moment that he lives; if he kill him himſelf he cannot be queſtioned for it, becauſe as ſoon as the one is dead the other is King, for here the King never dies.</p>
            <p>If therefore the next of blood has ſo abſolute a Right, the King is very unſafe: For though the D. be not inclined to ſhorten his Brothers days, nay though he be averſe to it, yet in obedience to the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Prieſts,</hi> it muſt be done either by himſelf or ſome other hand, and then how long we expect his Majeſties life?</p>
            <pb n="99" facs="tcp:58538:59"/>
            <p>If Kings were good Men an abſolute Monarchy were the beſt Government, but we ſee that they are ſubject to the ſame Infirmities with other Men, and therefore it is neceſſary to bound their Power: And by reaſon that they are fleſh and blood, and the Nation is ſo apt to be bad by their Example, I believe was that wherefore God was averſe to let the <hi>Jews</hi> have a King; till they had Kings, they never revolted ſo wholly from him; when their Kings were good they were obedient to him, but when they were idolatrous then the People went mad of Idols. I hope it is no <hi>Regis ad exemplum</hi> that makes our Nation ſo lewd and wicked at this day.</p>

            <head>A SPEECH AGAINST Arbitrary and Illegal IMPRISONMENTS BY THE Privy Councill.</head>
            <p>THere is not any thing that an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> can claim as his Right, that we value more than Freedom and Liberty, I mean that of the Body; becauſe Impriſonment is a ſort of Death, and leſs tolerable to ſome than Death it ſelf: For by it we are deprived of all our Earthly Comforts. What is a Man the better for having never ſo great an Eſtate, never ſo great Honour, or what elſe is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable in this World, if he is reſtrained of his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty? Now there are ſeveral ſorts of Reſtraints or Impriſonments, and they are all forbidden by our Law, unleſs the cauſe be very juſt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable; not for bare ſurmiſes or vain ſtories that a Man ſhall be impriſoned and hurried from his aboad, but only for ſuch cauſe as ſhall prove that it is for the good of the Government, and the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:58538:60"/>of it, that this or that Man is impriſoned or reſtrained. Although the Law has taken very good care, yet the Subject is often abuſed in his Liberty, ſometimes by the Courts in <hi>Weſt-Hall,</hi> ſometimes by other Courts and particular Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates: But the greateſt cauſe of complaint pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the <hi>Privy Council.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Privy Council</hi> that is, though they have been much to blame in this particular, yet it is not a new thing that they practice, but this Itch of ſending for and impriſoning the Subject upon vain pretences has deſcended from one <hi>Privy Council</hi> to another, like an Infirmity that runs in a Blood; for no ſooner is a Man made a <hi>Privy Councellor,</hi> but this Spirit reſts upon him. This Miſchief was early eſpied, even in <hi>Henry</hi> III's. time, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Lawes have been made to reſtrain the <hi>Privy Council.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the 9. <hi>H.</hi> 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 29. it's declared that No <hi>Free-man</hi> ſhall be taken or impriſoned, or be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſed of his Free-hold or Liberties, or Free Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, or be out-lawed, or any other way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, nor we will not paſs upon him, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him, but by Lawful Judgment of his Peers, or by the Law of the Land.</p>
            <p>By the 5. <hi>Edw.</hi> III. 9. It is Enacted, That no Man from thenceforth ſhall be attacht by any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, nor fore-judged of Life or Limb, nor his Lands, Tenements, Goods nor Chattels ſeized into the Kings Hands, againſt the Form of the <hi>Great Charter,</hi> and the Law of the Land.</p>
            <p>By 25. <hi>Edw.</hi> III. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. It is declared, That from thenceforth none ſhall be taken by Petition or Suggeſtion made to our Lord the King, or to his <hi>Council,</hi> unleſs it be by Indictment or Preſentment
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:58538:61"/>of his good and lawful people of the ſame Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, where ſuch Deeds be done in due man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or by Proceſs made by Writ original at the Common Law, Nor that none be out of his Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes, nor of his Free-holds, unleſs he be duly brought in anſwer, and fore-judged of the ſame by the Courſe of the Law. And if any thing be done againſt the ſame, it ſhall be redreſſed and holden for none.</p>
            <p>By 28. <hi>Edw.</hi> III. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. It is Eſtabliſht, That no Man, of what Eſtate or Condition that he be, ſhall be put out of Land or Tenement, nor taken, nor impriſoned, nor diſinherited, nor put to death, without being brought in anſwer by due proceſs of Law.</p>
            <p>And by 37. <hi>Edw.</hi> III. <hi>Chap.</hi> 18. It ſays, Tho' it be contained in the <hi>Great Charter,</hi> That no Man be taken nor impriſoned, nor put out of his Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, without proceſs of the Law, nevertheleſs divers people make falſe Suggeſtions to the King himſelf, as well for Malice as otherwiſe, whereof the King is often grieved, and divers of the Realm put in damage, againſt the Form of the ſame <hi>Charter:</hi> Wherefore it is ordained, That all they which make ſuggeſtion ſhall be ſent with the ſame ſuggeſtions before the Chancellor, Treaſurer and his Grand Council, and that they there find Surety to purſue their ſuggeſtions, and incur the ſame pain that the other ſhould have had if he were attainted, in caſe that his ſuggeſtions be found evil: And that then proceſs of the Law be made againſt them without being taken and impriſoned againſt the Form of the ſaid <hi>Charter,</hi> and other Statutes.</p>
            <p>In the 38. <hi>Edw.</hi> III. <hi>Chap.</hi> 9. is contained the Informers puniſhment, in theſe Words, It is
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:58538:61"/>aſſented, That if he that maketh the complaint, cannot prove his Intent againſt the Defendant by the Proceſs limited in the ſame Article, he ſhall be commanded to Priſon, there to abide till he hath made gree to the Party of his damages, and of the ſlander that he hath ſuffered by ſuch occaſion, and after ſhall make fine and ranſome to the King. And the Point contained in the ſame Article, that the Plantiff ſhall incur the ſame pain, which the other ſhould have if he were attainted, ſhall be out in caſe that his ſuggeſtion be found untrue.</p>
            <p>And ſtill there is another Law made 42. <hi>Edw.</hi> III. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. In theſe Words: At the Requeſt of the <hi>Commons,</hi> by their Petitions put forth in this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to eſchew the Michiefs and Damage done to divers of his <hi>Commons</hi> by falſe Accuſers, which oftentimes have made their Accuſations more for revenge, and ſingular benefit, than for the profit of the King or his people: which accuſed Perſons, ſome have been taken, and ſometime cauſed to come before the Kings <hi>Council</hi> by Writ, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe upon grievous pain againſt the Law. It is aſſented and accorded for the good Governance of the <hi>Commons,</hi> That no Man be put to anſwer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preſentment before Juſtices, or Matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, or by due proceſs, and Writ original, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the old Law of the Land. And if any thing from henceforth be done to the contrary, it ſhall be void in the Law, and holden for errour.</p>
            <p>Theſe are Laws that are as much in force as any Statutes whatever, and ought to be as duly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: But I beſeech you conſider to what a degree they have been violated by the <hi>Privy Counſel:</hi> How have they ſent for Gentlemen from all parts of the Nation, upon meer Flamms and Stories?
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:58538:62"/>No Man could be quiet, but upon any groundleſs pretence away went a Meſſenger, to bring up that Man, not conſidering the great charge and trouble they put the Gentleman upon by it. I will men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only that of Sir <hi>Giles Gerrard;</hi> he was ſent for up by a Meſſenger to anſwer to I know not what, a buſineſs about a <hi>Black Box,</hi> and who charged him with it: But when it came to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined it proved nothing but Town-talk, and what a pudder did they make? In our Countrey when a Man makes a great ſtir about a matter, and it ends in nothing that is ſignificant, we ſay, <hi>Billy has found a Pin:</hi> So I pray what did this hurly burly of the <hi>Black Box</hi> end in, but nothing that was worth a ſtraw? And to this mighty purpoſe Sir <hi>Giles</hi> was fetcht from his Houſe in the Country: And ſeveral other Gentlemen have been thus uſed againſt Law and Reaſon. It's ſtrange the <hi>Privy Council</hi> ſhould not remember the Bill of <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> which paſſed in the laſt Parliament, that might have brought to their remembrance theſe Laws that I have mentioned, and might further convince them how precious a thing we eſteem our Liberty: It puts me in mind of the Petition of Right, and what I have heard and read after it was paſſed, how ſoon it was violated and broken.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Privy Council</hi> has been very unjuſt to theſe Gentlemen whom they have moleſted by their Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, in that they have not made their Accuſers to find Sureties to make good their Accuſations as the Law requires, 37. <hi>Edw.</hi> III. 18. for then idle Stories would not be ſo currant by reaſon of the Puniſhment inflicted on thoſe falſe Accuſers by 37. <hi>Edw.</hi> III. 18. and 38. <hi>Edw.</hi> III. 9. which
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:58538:62"/>Lawes are grounded upon the Word of God, <hi>Deuteronomie</hi> 19. <hi>chap.</hi> 18. and 19. <hi>ver.</hi> But now ſuch Fellows as are mentioned in the 37. <hi>Edw.</hi> III. 18. and in 42. <hi>Edw.</hi> III. 3. who make their Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation for Malice, or for Revenge, or ſingular be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, more than for the Profit of the King, or his People; theſe I ſay, ſhall be allowed to accuſe honeſt Men, though they cannot prove a word of what they ſay, and for theſe devices are we to be forc't from our Habitations to appear before the King and his <hi>Council.</hi> Methinks it's hard play, and yet what remedy have we left but to ſit down and be quiet? But without doubt the Land intended a Redreſs in theſe Caſes, for 25. <hi>Edw.</hi> III. 4. ſays, that whatever is done contrary to that Law ſhall be redreſs't and holden for none; but it does not tell us how ſatisfaction is to be had: But ſince it is left uncertain, I hope for the future we ſhall ſo order it, that every Man may have relief againſt this great Oppreſſion, and that I humbly move; for if we let this alone, we leave an Arbitrary uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable Power in the <hi>Privy Council,</hi> which will never ſtop till it has made the Law ſubject to them.</p>
            <p>But I have heard it objected, that if this Power of ſending for People be not allowed to the <hi>Privy Council,</hi> then you put them in a worſer condition than any Juſtice of Peace, becauſe by his War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant he can ſend for any body in the County where he lives. I muſt in the firſt place deny this alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; for the conſequence is not true: In the next place, I ſay that the Law is the beſt Judge of this, whether the <hi>Privy Council</hi> ought to have ſuch an unlimited Power, and what the Law has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined over and over again ought not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:58538:63"/>by us; beſides it is a thing of dangerous conſequence to put Diſcretion into the Ballance with ſo many written Lawes which conſerve ſo dear a thing as our Liberty.</p>
            <p>But the Power of the <hi>Privy Council</hi> is not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made leſs than that of a Juſtice of Peace; for a Juſtice of Peace it is to be ſuppoſed will not ſend out his Warrant but upon a juſt and reaſonable ground: What Juſtice of Peace ever ſent out a Warrant of the good Behaviour againſt any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but he either firſt heard the party accuſed, (which is the juſter way) or elſe the matter was proved upon Oath? Or when was any Warrant of the Peace iſſued out but it was grounded upon the Oath of him that demanded the Surety of Peace? And whatever Warrants or Precepts are granted by a Juſtice of Peace, they ought to be for juſt cauſes, or elſe he violates his Truſt: So the <hi>Privy Council</hi> may upon a juſt Accuſation ſend for any perſon, but without that they cannot, and therefore I do not ſee wherein a Juſtice of Peace has a greater power than the <hi>Privy Council,</hi> or if he had, yet it would not be ſo great a Miſchief, for he can only ſend for any perſon that is in the County; but the <hi>Privy Council</hi> are not limited to this or that County, but their power extends all over <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But beſides, it is unjuſt to be puniſht without a cauſe, and reſtraint or being debarr'd of Liberty is a puniſhment, and whoever he be that would have the <hi>Privy Council</hi> to exerciſe this Power, when he has known what it is to be brought up by a Meſſenger upon an Idle Story, let him then tell me how he likes it, and anſwer me if he can.</p>

            <head>A SPEECH AGAINST THE <hi>Biſhops Voting</hi> In Caſe of BLOOD.</head>
            <p>OF all the things that were ſtarted to hinder the ſucceſs of the laſt Parliament, and is like to be ſo great a ſtumbling-block in the next, That of the Biſhops Voting in Caſe of Blood was and will be the chief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now they that deny that the Biſhops have right to Vote in Caſe of Blood, do labour under two great difficulties; firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this is a new thing, at leaſt it is very long ſince the like Caſe has come into debate: And next, becauſe they are put to prove a negative, which is a great diſadvantage. But Truth will appear from under all the falſe gloſſes and umbrages that men may draw over it: And I doubt not to make it evident, that the Biſhops have no right to Vote in Caſe of Blood, at leaſt I hope I ſhall not be guilty of obſtinacy if I do not alter my opinion till what I have to ſay be anſwered.</p>
            <pb n="108" facs="tcp:58538:64"/>
            <p>It is ſtrange the Biſhops are ſo jealous of their Cauſe as not to adventure it on their great <hi>Diana</hi> the <hi>Canon Law;</hi> by which they are expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to meddle in caſe of Blood. Perhaps they would do by the <hi>Canon Law,</hi> as it is ſaid by the Idolaters in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> that part of the timber they made a god and fell down and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped it, the reſt of it they either burnt in the fire, or caſt it to the dunghil: For they tell you that the <hi>Canon Law</hi> was aboliſht by the Reformation, and that none but <hi>Papiſts</hi> yeild obedience to it; and therefore now they are not tyed up by the <hi>Canon Law,</hi> but may ſit and Vote in caſe of Blood if they pleaſe. I ſhould be very glad if they were as averſe to <hi>Popery</hi> in every thing elſe, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly that they would leave Ceremonies indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and not contend ſo highly for them, whereby they make the breach wider, and heighten the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences among Proteſtants; in the doing of which they do the <hi>Pope</hi>'s work moſt effectually. I wiſh they would conſent to have a new Book of <hi>Canons;</hi> for thoſe that are now extant are the old <hi>Popiſh Canons.</hi> I like Biſhops very well; but I wiſh that Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were reduced to their primitive Inſtitution; for I fear whilſt there is in <hi>England</hi> a Lord Biſhop the Church will not ſtand very ſteddily. But I will leave this (though I need ſay no more) and proceed to other things that are very clear as I conceive.</p>
            <p>My Lord <hi>Cook</hi> in the <hi>Second Part</hi> of his <hi>Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,</hi> the firſt <hi>Chapter,</hi> treating of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> when he reckons up the Priviledges of the Church, he tells us, that Clergy-men ſhall not be elected or have to do in ſecular Office; and therefore he tells us, that they are diſcharged of ſuch and ſuch bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens that Lay perſons were ſubject to; and good
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:58538:64"/>reaſon it ſhould be ſo, that they might with greater eaſe and ſecurity attend the buſineſs of their Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that is, to govern and inſtruct the Church: But whether they had theſe Immunities granted them, that they might ſtudy the Pleas of the Crown and Law Caſes, or elſe that they might apply themſelves to the work of the Miniſtry, let any Man judge; for ſaith he, <hi>Nemo militans Deo implicet ſe negotiis ſecularibus:</hi> And if to ſit and judge in caſe of Blood be not a ſecular Matter I have no more to ſay; and I hope my Lord <hi>Cook</hi>'s Authority will be allowed.</p>
            <p>And becauſe as I conceive that my Lord <hi>Cook</hi>'s Authority may paſs Muſter in this point; I will offer ſome things out of him, that will make it evident that the Biſhops are only Lords of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not Peers, and if ſo, it is againſt the Law of <hi>England</hi> for them to ſit and judge upon any Peer for his Life; for the Law ſays, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man ſhall be tried by his Peers.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Second Part</hi> of his <hi>Inſtitutes,</hi> the firſt <hi>Chapter,</hi> he tells us, that every Arch-Biſhop that holds of the King <hi>per Baroniam,</hi> and called by Writ to Parliament, is a Lord of Parliament: But in the 14th. <hi>Chapter,</hi> when he reckons up who are <hi>Pares</hi> in the Lords Houſe, he ſays not a word of the Biſhops, but repeats all the other Degrees of Lords, as Dukes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And without doubt he would not have made ſo great an omiſſion if the Biſhops ought to have been taken into the number.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, if the Biſhops be <hi>Pares,</hi> how comes it to paſs that an Act of Parliament ſhall be good to which their conſent is not had, paſſed by the King, Lords Temporal, and Commons? But it was never allowed for an Act of Parliament where
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:58538:65"/>the Lords Temporal had not given their Vote: And for proof hereof ſee my Lord <hi>Cook</hi> in his <hi>Chap. De Aſportatis Religioſorum,</hi> where he gives you ſeveral Inſtances of Acts of Parliament that paſſed and the Biſhops abſent.</p>
            <p>But then in the <hi>Third Part</hi> of his <hi>Inſtitutes</hi> he there puts the matter out of all controverſie, and ſhews that Biſhops are to be tried by Commoners; for ſays he, in the ſecond <hi>Chap.</hi> treating of Petty Treaſon, <hi>None ſhall be tried by his Peers, but only ſuch as ſit there</hi> ratione Nobilitatis, <hi>as Dukes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and reckons the ſeveral Degrees; and not ſuch as are Lords of Parliament</hi> ratione Baroniarum, quas tenent in Jure Eccleſiae, <hi>as Arch-Biſhops, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and formerly Abbots and Priors; but they</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall be tryed by the Country, that is by the Free-holders, for that they are not of the Degree of Nobility.</hi> So that with ſubmiſſion this is as clear as any thing in the World.</p>
            <p>If the point be ſo clear that the Biſhops may Vote in caſe of Blood, it would do well that ſome Preſidents were produced, by which it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that they have ever done it, at leaſt that they have made uſe of it in ſuch times when the Nation was in quiet, and matters were carried fairly; for Inſtances from Times of Confuſion or Rebellion, help rather to pull down than ſupport a Cauſe: But my Lord <hi>Cook</hi> in his <hi>Chap.</hi> (that I mentioned even now) <hi>De Aſportatis Religioſorum,</hi> gives you ſeveral Preſidents where the Biſhops when Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Matters were to be debated in the Lords Houſe withdrew themſelves, particularly 2 of <hi>Rich.</hi> II. the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> made a ſolemn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation in the Parliament for himſelf and the Clergy of his Province, for that Matters of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:58538:65"/>were to be entreated of, whereat by the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Law</hi> they ought not to be preſent; they therefore abſented themſelves.</p>
            <p>But in regard I have hitherto voucht my Lord <hi>Cook</hi> for what I have ſaid, I deſire that it may be obſerved that he wrote ſince the Reformation, and what was Law when he wrote is Law at this day, unleſs it be changed by ſome Act of Parliament made ſince; and therefore he that denies my Lord <hi>Cook</hi> to have written Law muſt produce ſome Act of Parliament whereby it does appear that the Law is altered ſince his time. Beſides this, the Biſhops and other Clergy were called to Parliament very uncertainly, ſometimes more, ſometimes fewer, and ſometimes none at all, as it was in <hi>Edw.</hi> I. time.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſeeing the caſe to be thus, That the Biſhops are not Peers but only Lords of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That an Act of Parliament is good though they be abſent, That they are to be tried by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners, And that when Capital Matters were to be debated, they have withdrawn themſelves, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring at the ſame time that they ought not to have to do in ſuch things, And alſo, that they have not ſo abſolute a Right to ſit and Vote in the Houſe as the Temporal Lords have, becauſe they are called to Parliament ſo uncertainly; I ſhall be glad to hear what can be ſaid to make their Right unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable: But if all this were ſet aſide, yet it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains on their part to prove that they have ſate in Judgment upon the Peers. I am apt to believe, they will be hardly put to it to produce any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident out of good Times, when the Nation was in quiet, and the Law had its courſe; Nay, I think they can ſcarcey find any, that the Proceeds of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:58538:66"/>that Parliament when it was done, were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed by Act of Parliament, and ſtand ſo at this day: And I ſhould alſo be glad to ſee that when a Peer has been tried out of Parliament that any Biſhop was ever nominated to ſit upon that Lord accuſed; for out of Parliament if a Peer be tryed for his life it is by a ſelect Number named by the King; and if the Biſhops have Right to ſit and Vote upon the Peers, it is ſtrange methinks that there is not any Inſtance to be found, where the Biſhops or any of them have been named to Judge a Lord out of Parliament. Now the reaſon (as I conceive) how this comes to paſs is, becauſe it was never known that a Biſhop was tried by the Lords out of Parliament, and therefore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not try a Lord out of Parliament, becauſe they are not Peers; for the Lords have never tryed any Biſhop but in Parliament, and that was always upon Impeachments, and not otherwiſe: And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Impeachment they may try other Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as well as Biſhops.</p>
            <p>Beſides this it is plain, that the Clergy, even in the time of <hi>Popery,</hi> would not have to do with Blood in any caſe whatſoever: For when they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed all Offices and Places of Honour or profit, you ſhall not find any Biſhop that was Lord Chief Juſtice of the Kings Bench, or Judge of any Court where Mens Lives were to be meddled with; and the Clergy were not ſo ignorant or backward in their Intereſt, as to let ſlip ſuch profitable places, had it ſuited with their Function.</p>
            <p>I have often conſidered with my ſelf, what it is that has induced ſo many of the Temporal Lords to contend for the Biſhops in this caſe: I cannot perceive but that it is againſt themſelves that they
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:58538:66"/>ſtrive; for without doubt, the fewer that the Temporal Lords are, the more conſiderable they are, and why they ſhould ſtrive to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves leſs I cannot comprehend; neither can any reaſon be aſſigned but that which is obvious to every Mans Thoughts: That there is ſome ſecret power that governs their Lordſhips in this Affair: But without doubt this powerful hand would not be able to turn the Scales ſo very much, if Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had been beſtowed only on ſuch as deſerved Honour. But when Intereſt prevails above Merit, no wonder that a Word or a Look do command ſo abſolutely; And yet there is this to be ſaid for the Lord's Houſe, that there are a great many Lords who retain the Worth and Honour of their Anceſtors: That notwithſtanding being frowned upon, diſplaced, and all poſſible diſcouragements, yet have they ſhewed themſelves to be Men of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Principles; that they will ſerve the King as <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> but will not give up any of their juſt Rights to pleaſe him.</p>
            <p>If the Biſhops had never ſo clear a Right in this matter, the it is to be conſider'd, that whatever Right they have, that it was gained in the times of Superſtition and Blindneſs, when the Clergy Uſurped and Lorded it over the Nation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in regard that <hi>England</hi> has now recovered its Eye-ſight and Underſtanding; they are very unthankful if they do not reduce every thing to its proper Station: And if the Biſhops are prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a Law not to Vote in Caſe of Blood, or are abridged in any other Matter where the Intereſt of the King and People require, yet the Church is not prejudiced, for my Lord <hi>Cook</hi> tells us in the ſecond part of his Inſtitutes</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nec debet dici in praejudicium Eccleſiae libertatis,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:58538:67"/>quod pro Rege, &amp; Reipublicae neceſſarium invenitur:</hi> And whether it be not for the Intereſt of the King and People that the Biſhops ſhall not Vote in caſe of Blood, I ſubmit to any Man that wiſhes well to <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I would fain be ſatisfied why our Biſhops are more forward to have to do in caſe of Blood, than the Biſhops and Clergy in the time of Popery, it's plain they always declined it; but ours will adventure a Kingdom upon it: It's true they will withdraw upon the Tryal of the Five Popiſh Lords, but they will not upon Tryal of my Lord <hi>D—s</hi> Pardon, yet thus far they condeſcend, that when Judgment is to be pronounced, they will withdraw: Very well, Firſt it is confeſſed on all hands, that if my Lord <hi>D—s</hi> Pardon do not hold good, he dyes for it: And next I would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtand the difference in this caſe, when a Man is tryed for his Life before ſeveral Judges; and all of them, though he is Innocent, reſolve that he ſhall be pronounced guilty, but they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw themſelves, and leave one of their Brethren to paſs the Sentence: Now the queſtion is, Whether the reſt that were abſent are not as guilty of ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Innocent Blood, as he who pronounced the Sentence: And ſo on the contrary, for any other thing whatever: And whether this does not reach the caſe in hand I humbly ſubmit: But the truth of the matter is, the Biſhops do know that if my Lord <hi>D—s</hi> Pardon be allowed, then Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Power comes in with a Powder: And then will be their Harveſt, and here's the ſhort and long of the caſe: And therefore the Parliament muſt never yield that the Biſhops ſhall Vote in caſe of Blood; for the conſequence of it will be to alter the very Frame of our Government, and curſed be he that removes his Neighbours Landmark.</p>

            <head>A SPEECH AGAINST THE PENSIONERS IN K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. Reign.</head>
            <p>WIthout doubt the laſt Parliament had great Matters in agitation, and the inquiry they made about the Penſioners of the preceding Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was no ſmall one, but rather one of the chief things they had in hand; for had they been permitted to have perfected that, it had been a good recompence for the diſappointment which the Nation ſuſtain'd in their other expectations, by the ſuddain Prorogation: And without all queſtion, nothing is fitter for the thoughts of a Parliament, than to take into conſideration how to puniſh them that had proved the Peſt, and had almoſt (if not altogether) ruin'd the Nation; and how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the like miſchief for the future.</p>
            <pb n="116" facs="tcp:58538:68"/>
            <p>The Name of a Penſioner is very diſtaſtful to every <hi>Engliſh</hi> Spirit; and all thoſe who were Penſioners I think are ſufficiently deſpiſed by their Country-men: And therefore I will mention only two or three things that will lye at their doors; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I offer my advice what is to be done.</p>
            <p>Breach of Truſt is accounted the moſt infamous thing in the World, and this theſe Men were guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of to the higheſt degree; Robbery and Stealing our Law puniſhes with Death, and what deſerve they who beggar and take away all that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has, under the Protection of diſpoſing of the Peoples Money for the honour and good of the King and Kingdom: And if there were nothing more than this to be ſaid, without doubt they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a high cenſure.</p>
            <p>Beſides the giving away ſuch vaſt Sums, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any colour or reaſonable pretence: There is this great miſchief will follow upon it: Every man very well knows that it has put the King into an extraordinary way of expence: And therefore when he has not ſuch great ſupplyes, it muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity bring the King into great want and need: And ſhall not only give him an ill opinion of all Parliaments that do not ſupply him ſo extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly, but perhaps put him to think of ways to get Money that otherwiſe would never have entred into his thoughts; ſo that whatever ill may happen of this ſort, theſe Penſioners are anſwerable for it.</p>
            <p>Furthermore they have layd us open to all our Enemies, whoever will invade may not doubt to ſubdue us: For they have taken from us the Sinews of War, that is Money and Courage, all our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is gone, and they have exhauſted the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Nation, and when People are poor,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:58538:68"/>their Spirits are low, ſo that we are left without a defence, and who muſt we thank for bringing us into this deſpicable condition, but theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who notwithſtanding this had the face to ſtyle themſelves the Kings Friends, and all thoſe who oppoſed their practices were Factious and Seditious. They had brought it to that paſs that Debates could not be free, if a Gentlemans Tongue happen to lye a little awry in his Mouth, preſently he muſt be called to the Bar, or if that would not do, whenſoever any Gentleman that had a true <hi>Engliſh</hi> Spirit happen'd to ſay any thing that was bold; preſently away to ſeek the King and tell him of it; and often times more than the Truth: And thus they indeavoured to get an ill Opinion in the King of his beſt Subjects: And their practice was the more abominable, becauſe their Words and Actions gave the occaſion to force thoſe ſmart Expreſſions from the Gentlemen that ſpoke them, for their honeſt hearts were fired with true Zeal to their King and Countrey, when they beheld the impudence and falſeneſs of thoſe Penſioners.</p>
            <p>It's true we find that in or about the 10th year of <hi>Richard</hi> II. it was indeavoured to get a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Parliament; for our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Story ſays that the King ſent for the Juſtices and Sheriffs, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd them to do their beſt, that none ſhould be choſen Knights and Burgeſſes, but ſuch as the King and his Council ſhould name, but we find it could not be effected.</p>
            <p>The next that occurs to my thoughts is that in the 4th year of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. the Parliament that was called at <hi>Coventry,</hi> named the Lay-mens Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:58538:69"/>for the Sheriffs were appointed that none ſhould be choſen Knights or Burgeſſes, that had any skill in the Laws of the Land.</p>
            <p>The next that I remember is that in <hi>Henry</hi> VI. time, in the year 1449, or 50, when the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> was Accuſed by the Commons, and Committed to the <hi>Tower,</hi> the King Diſſolved that Parliament not far unlike our caſe of my Lord <hi>D</hi>—, but it differs in this, that <hi>Suffolk</hi> was Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the <hi>Tower</hi> as of right he ought, but we were deny'd that Juſtice againſt <hi>D</hi>—, only <hi>Henry</hi> VI. made the caſes thus far even that he ſet <hi>Suffolk</hi> at liberty after he had Diſſolv'd that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: Soon after a Parliament was called, wherein great care was taken in chooſing of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Men that ſhould favour <hi>Suffolk:</hi> But they ſo far failed of their purpoſe, that his appearance at the Parliament gave great diſtaſte to the Houſe of Commons, and they were ſo far incenſed, that they began the Parliament with a freſh Accuſation againſt him and others: So that you may ſee that it was not in the power of the Court to corrupt the Houſe of Commons.</p>
            <p>In the time of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII about the 20th year of his Reign when the Parliament was active againſt Pluralities, and Non-Reſidence there was an Act paſſed to releaſe to the King all ſuch Sums of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney as he had borrowed at the Loan, in the 15th year of his Reign; it's ſaid that it was much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, but the reaſon that is given why it paſſed is, becauſe the Houſe was moſtly the Kings Servants; but it gave great diſturbance to the Nation: And this is the only caſe that I can remember that comes any thing near to our Penſioners; but we cannot
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:58538:69"/>find that they or any Parliament took Money to Vote: So that we muſt conclude that there was never any Penſioners in Parliament till this Pack of Blades were got together.</p>
            <p>Therefore Sir, what will you do? Shall theſe Men eſcape, ſhall they go free with their Booty: Shall not the Nation have Vengeance on them, who had almoſt given up the Government: It was they who had perverted the ends of Parliaments: Parliaments have been and are the great Refuge of the Nation, that which cures all its Diſeaſes, and heals it Soars: But the Men had made it a Snare to the Nation, and at beſt had brought it to be an Engine to give Money; If therefore theſe go away unpuniſht, we countenance what they have done, and make way to have Penſioners in every Parliament; but far be any ſuch thought from any Man that ſits within theſe Walls: And having ſaid this, I will in the next place humbly offer my thoughts what is to be done.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place I do propoſe that every Man of them ſhall on their knees confeſs their fault to all the Commons, and that to be done at this Bar one by one.</p>
            <p>Next, That as far as they are able, that they refund all the Money they have received for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Service. Our Law will not allow a Thief to keep what he has got, by ſtealth, but of courſe orders reſtitution, and ſhall theſe proud Robbers of the Nation, not reſtore their ill gotten goods?</p>
            <p>And laſtly, I do propoſe that they be Voted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of ſerving in Parliament for the future, or of injoying any Office Civil or Military, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:58538:70"/>order a Bill to be brought in to that purpoſe: For it's not fit, that they who were ſo falſe and unjuſt in that Truſt, ſhould ever be truſted again: This Sir is my Opinion, but if the Houſe ſhall incline to any other way, I ſhall readily comply, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a ſufficient mark of Infamy be ſet on them, that the People may know who bought and Sold them.</p>

            <head>A SPEECH For the Sitting of PARLIAMENTS, And againſt FAVOURITES.</head>
            <p>A King of <hi>England</hi> at the head of his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is in his full ſtrength and power, and in his greateſt Splendor and Glory: It is then that he can do great things, and without a Parliament he is not very formidable. Therefore when Kings leave off the uſe of Parliaments, and rely upon the Advice of particular Favourites; they forſake their chiefeſt Intereſt, they lay aſide the Staff that ſupports them to lean upon a broken Reed that will run into their hands; and this is proved by the Example of former Kings: What Kings per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd ſuch Enterprizes, and did ſuch wonderful things, as thoſe who ſtill conſulted their Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? And who had more the Command of the Peoples Purſes than thoſe Kings who met the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives frequently in Parliament? As Witneſs <hi>Hen.</hi> I. <hi>Edw.</hi> I. <hi>Edw.</hi> III. <hi>Hen.</hi> V. <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> and what Kings were ſo mean and obſcure, deſpiſed by
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:58538:71"/>their Neighbours and abhorr'd by their Subjects as thoſe who left off the uſe of Parliaments and doted upon their Favourites: As witneſs <hi>Will.</hi> II. King <hi>John, Henry</hi> III. <hi>Edward</hi> II. <hi>Richard</hi> II. <hi>Henry</hi> VI. And I think it's undeniable that when the King leaves off Parliaments he forſakes his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, he refuſes the good and chooſes the bad.</p>
            <p>I wiſh it could not be ſaid that for two years laſt paſt, the uſe of Parliaments has almoſt been laid aſide: It's too true that Parliaments have been delayed, and there is but a little between de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying and denying, and the firſt ſtep to a denyal is to delay: Every Man knows the great need we have had of a Parliament theſe Seventeenth Months, and why has it not met till now: It's very well known how earneſtly it was deſired by all good Proteſtants and true <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> and what appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations have been made to His Majeſtie that it might ſit; and it could not be obtain'd till now: And it is not to be forgotten how often it has been Prorogued, and the Notice that has been given to the Nation of the ſeveral Prorogations; the firſt time that we heard of them was by the <hi>Gazett,</hi> in which is ſeldom any thing of truth, and then out comes a Proclamation for a Prorogation about a day or two before the day of meeting: When Gentlemen have diſpoſed their Affairs that they may attend at the Parliament, and poſſibly were on their Journey towards <hi>London,</hi> upon the Road they meet the News of the Prorogation, very good uſage, and there is nothing to be ſaid in Juſtification of ſuch ſhort Notice, but that when His Majeſty by His Proclamation had appointed a farther time for the meeting of the Parliament, that in plain
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:58538:71"/>
               <hi>Engliſh</hi> no Man muſt believe it would meet: For if Gentlemen did believe it, they would prepare for it, and if they are prepared, it's but reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that ſufficient Notice ſhould be given to prevent them: Certainly they who adviſed the King in this matter, intended that none of His Majeſties Proclamations ſhould have any credit: For His Majeſty he put out ſeveral Proclamations againſt the Papiſts, and we ſee how they are regarded, not the leaſt obedience yielded to them: And this giving of ſuch ſhort notice, was certainly done on purpoſe that thoſe Proclamations ſhould neither be obeyed nor believed: Thus is the K. abuſed, thus does he looſe the hearts of his People, and thus is the Nation abuſed: What will become of us when we cannot believe what His Majeſty ſays: Out of Parliament the King cannot ſpeak to his People in a more notable way than by Proclamation, and as the matter is order'd theſe are not regarded: In a Subject nothing is more Infamous, than to ſay of him, that his word is not to be relyed on, he does not regard what he ſays: And therefore what Villains are they, who by their Advice, do bring the King but into the ſuſpition of it.</p>
            <p>This delaving of Parliaments ſeems to portend the laying of Parliaments aſide; and if ſo, an Army will follow, for the King muſt govern either by a Parliament or an Army, for one of them he muſt have; now the way to get rid of Parliaments is this: Firſt, Although they meet ſometimes, yet ſomething muſt be ſtarted to hinder their ſucceſs, or if that wont do, Prorogue or Diſſolve them before any thing be finiſht, and thus Parliaments will be made uſeleſs, and this being done, it will
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:58538:72"/>not be long before they become burdenſome, and then away with them for good and all.</p>
            <p>Kings only then grow out of conceit with Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments when their Favourites are ſo overgrown, and their Actions are ſo exorbitant, that they will not indure to be ſcann'd by a Parliament: And therefore to ſave themſelves, they perſwade the King to keep off the Parliament, though it be to his great hurt: For the laſt Trump at the Day of Judgment will not be more terrible to the World, than the ſound of an approaching Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to unjuſt Miniſters and Favourites.</p>
            <p>That State is ſick of a grievous Diſtemper when Kings neglect their Parliaments, and adhere to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, and certainly that woe is then fallen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Nation which <hi>Solomon</hi> denounces; for ſays he, woe to that Nation whoſe King is a Child: And without queſtion he meant a Child in Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and not in Years: We have had in <hi>England</hi> Kings who when they were Children, by the help of a wiſe Council have govern'd very well: But after that they took matters into their own hands it went very ill with <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>Richard</hi> II. <hi>Henry</hi> VI. who whileſt they were Children, the Government was ſteer'd aright; but their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding not growing as faſt as their Years, they aſſumed the Government before they were ready for it; and ſo managed matters, that it's better not to name them, than to reckon them in the Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of the Kings.</p>
            <p>And there is yet another reaſon why great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites ſhould adviſe againſt Parliaments: Kings that dote too much upon their Favourites, do for the moſt part pick up mean Men, people of no Fortunes or Eſtates, upon whom it is that they
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:58538:72"/>place their favour to ſo high a degree: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's for their Intereſt to adviſe the King to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern by an Army, for if he prevails, then they are ſure to have what heart can wiſh; or if he fail, yet they are but where they were, they had no thing, and they can looſe nothing.</p>
            <p>There is no Man but very plainly ſees, that there are People about His Majeſty who adviſe him to ſhake off the Fetters of the Lawes, and to govern Arbitrarily, and I wiſh that their Advice have not prevailed for the moſt part, yet I think His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties own Inclinations, do not bend that way, for he ſeems to love quiet and eaſe, which no Prince can have that Rules by an Army: Therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can expect that His Majeſty will come in to us, theſe People of Arbitrary Principles muſt be removed from his Throne; for whileſt there are the ſame Adviſers, we muſt expect the ſame Advice whileſt there are the ſame Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, we muſt expect the ſame Reſults: And this alone will not do it, it's but the firſt ſtep to our happyneſs, the Principles or Maxims of State muſt be removed, it's not taking away this or the other Man, and putting in another to act by the ſame Rules that will cure our Diſeaſe; but it's the change of Principles that muſt do it.</p>
            <p>You may remember in the laſt Parliament the change that was made in the Privy Council, and Miniſters, and upon the firſt news of it, I met with a Gentleman that had a great Service for <hi>White-Hall;</hi> ſays he, I hope now you are pleas'd, what can you expect more from His Majeſty? I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, I like it well, yet not ſo very well, for ſaid I, all is well that ends well, for all is not Gold that gliſters: I am not ſure, that theſe Men that
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:58538:73"/>are put out have not left their Principles behind them, when thoſe are gone I ſhall like it very well: The Man was angry, and flung away, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you are hard to pleaſe, and ſays I, you are eaſie, and ſo we parted.</p>
            <p>And I pray you, how much Wooll have we had after all this cry, what benefit have we reaped by that change: Do not we ſee that unleſs they would act by the Maximes of their Predeceſſors they muſt do nothing, and therefore ſeveral did deſire leave to go off: Some of theſe worthy Lords and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that did ſo are now in my eye, and I ſhall ever honour them for it: I cannot forget the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes made to the Parliament at the ſame time; and how well they have been kept.</p>
            <p>Therefore I think it's very plain that till theſe Principles are removed from <hi>White-hall,</hi> that all our labour and pains will end in nothing: The way then as I conceive to do this, is to lay before His Majeſty the ſtate of the caſe, let us ſhew him, how unable theſe Men are to ſerve him, and how deſtructive to his Intereſt it is to follow their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; and that he can be Safe and Great only by cloſing with his Parliament.</p>
            <p>Would His Majeſty be Safe, alas what can his Creatures do, juſt nothing, they have no Power, nor have they Will further than it ſerves for their own advantage: But His Majeſty is ſafe in his Parliament, for it is the Intereſt of every Man in <hi>England</hi> to preſerve and defend His Majeſties go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning by his Parliament.</p>
            <p>Does he want Money to make him eaſie? I pray what can he expect from the Catterpillers his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, their care is not how to ſerve him, but to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:58538:73"/>make their own Fortunes: But from his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he need not want very plentiful ſupplies to preſerve the Honour of himſelf and the Kingdom: Would he maintain his Dominions and Rights, what can his Creatures do, but when he cloſes with his Parliament, he can neither want the Heads, Hearts, and Purſes of his People to ſerve him: ſo that whatever His Majeſty would have, it is only to be had by his Parliament: For his Favourites cannot in the leaſt contribute to make him Safe or Honourable; or whatever elſe a King may want or deſire: All the Uſe a King can have from His Favourites, is to have Stories and Lies to ſet him at variance with his People. I hope when the Caſe is laid before His Majeſty, that he will cloſe with us; but if his Judgment is ſo prepoſſeſſed that it will not convince him of his Intereſt, then we muſt conclude that it is with him as it was with <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> who forſook the Council of the Old Men, and inclined to that of the Young Men, who councelled him to tell the People that his little Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſhould be thicker than his Fathers Loynes: And I pray what was the effect of that huffing Speech? Why Ten Tribes were taken from him, and it was not his Young Men that could recover them for him again; neither was it without a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament that his Majeſty was brought into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> I hope his Majeſty has not forgot it.</p>
            <p>Let them adviſe what they will, but I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent they will think on't a good while before they will adventure to put thoſe Arbitrary Councils in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Execution; it will prove a hot matter to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle: For though I hope no Man here will lift up his hand againſt His Majeſty, yet we may oppoſe
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:58538:74"/>any Man that does ſeek to invade our Properties: And for my own part I will Piſtol any Subject, be he the greateſt in <hi>England</hi> that ſhall in deavour to deprive me of my juſt Right: Let us do what we can to effect an Union between the King and his People, and leave that Succeſs to God Almighty, and his will be done.</p>

            <head>A SPEECH On the Occaſion of ſome JUSTICES Being put out of COMMISSION.</head>
            <p>I Was in hopes that ſome Gentlemen would have prevented me in what I have to ſay, for I fear the Houſe is under a great miſtake as to thoſe Gentlemen of the Houſe who are put out of the Commiſſion of the Peace: For it is to ſpeak to that chiefly I ſtand up: I acknowledge that it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable thing that other Gentlemen were put out, but no doubt it was upon very weighty and warrantable grounds that the Gentlemen of the Houſe were put out.</p>
            <p>For without doubt His Majeſty, or who he be that adviſed him to it, did think it reaſonable, and were ſenſible that we who attend the ſervice of our Country in this place, do ſpend our Time and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and neglect our own Affairs, and therefore when we come home, its fit that we have a time of reſt, and that we be eaſed both in our Bodies and Purſes, and be at leaſure to ſettle our own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:58538:75"/>and not that we ſhould be toſſed from one chargeable and troubleſome Imployment to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: So that we have great cauſe to be thankful for the care that is taken of us.</p>
            <p>Beſides, there is a further regard had to us; for this is a dangerous time to put the Laws in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the Papiſts, becauſe there are Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples where Magiſtrates ſome have been murdered, others attempted to be aſſaſſinated for putting the Laws in Execution againſt the Papiſts, and becauſe we appear'd to be zealous in it, therefore this care is taken off us; I ſuppoſe that might be the chief reaſon why I was put out, becauſe I have help't to convict above Five Thouſand Papiſts in <hi>Lancaſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And furthermore it was neceſſary to know how we ſtand in the thoughts of our Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whether they have a good opinion of us now we are turn'd out of Office, becauſe it look't like a deſign'd diſgrace: For my part it has gain'd me ground, and I believe every Gentleman elſe finds his Countreymen not to eſteem the worſe of him, I rather think better, therefore ſeeing our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys believe us to be honeſt Men, there's no great queſtion but we ſhall be in great eſteem at <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi> now they have had this Tryal of us: For <hi>White-hall</hi> is very apt to incline to the opinion of the Country: And that Cart is not well upon the Wheels, when it is otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Therefore for my part I am very thankful that I am put out. I'le aſſure you I find my Purſe the fuller for it, and I find my Countrey to pay me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together as much reſpect, if not more than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly: There is but one thing that I grudged to part with, and that was the Office of <hi>Cuſtos Rotu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum</hi>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:58538:75"/>which had been in my Family for ſeveral Generations, and for that I hop'd a particular rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon might have been aſſign'd why they took it from me, but from that day to this I cannot learn what was the cauſe: It's gone, and farewel it: And that's all the loſs I had by being put out of the Commiſſion of the Peace: I have done with our ſelves, and now give me leave to ſpeak a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning other Gentlemen who are put out, and no reaſon given for it.</p>
            <p>When any Gentleman is made a Juſtice of Peace, it is out of reſpect to him, and for the good of the Country, becauſe he is ſuppoſed to be honeſt and able, and without diſpute no Man ought to be put out; but either that he is unfaithful, unwilling to do his part, or elſe he does not underſtand it: And it's a great injuſtice to any Gentleman to put him out without hearing him; for to judge a Man unheard is not allowed by the Law. And what is it, but to judge a Mans Reputation a thing moſt dear to every honeſt Man: For in any Age but this it would be a great reflection upon a Gentleman to be turn'd out of the Commiſſion of the Peace: But God be thank't the Nation ſees very plainly who and what ſort of Perſons rule the Roſt: By all the inquiry I can make I do not find that any Man is put out, but ſuch as were very active againſt the Papiſts, ſuch as are againſt Arbitrary Power, and ſuch as approved of the Bill againſt the Duke: I wiſh they would give the reaſon why one Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was put out in my County, for beſides my ſelf there are but two put out, the one was newly put in, and had not acted, the other is an Ancient Juſtice of Peace, and a Man that cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in relation to the diſcharge of his truſt;
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:58538:76"/>without reflection or diminution to any Man, I think he knows the work of a Juſtice of Peace as well as any Man in <hi>England,</hi> I except no Man: And for his Integrity he may ſet all Men at defiance to accuſe him of the leaſt partiality in the diſcharge of his truſt: And I do know that no Man made it more his buſineſs than he did, that he might eaſe and ſerve the Country: For as his Ability was not Inferiour to that of any other Man, ſo did he moſt duly put the Laws in execution, eſpecially thoſe againſt the Papiſts: And therefore Sir on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of my Country I muſt complain, and demand to know the reaſon why he was put out, we are greatly hurt, we are deprived of a great aſſiſtance and relief, and we cannot be quiet till we are ſatisfied in that particular: And my Lord Chancellor or the Privy Council (whichſoever of them it is that put him out) will they not tell us why? Are they aſham'd to own the cauſe? What will it not bear water? I hate this as I do Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Power and Popery: Brave World, that we muſt be debarr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

It is the ſame thing not to have Laws, as to have Laws and not executed: I ſay no more, leaſt I may ſeem to ſpeak in my own caſe, for I do not deſire to have any thing done as to my own particular, but as to the Gentleman whoſe Character I have given you, and his Name I will acquaint you with, it is Sir <hi>Thomas Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waring,</hi> you muſt give me leave to be importunate, and preſs it again and again, that he may be again put into the Commiſſion of the Peace.</p>

            <head>A SPEECH For Baniſhing the PAPISTS.</head>
            <p>I Would be as backward to commit oppreſſion, as I will be to do any thing that God has forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den me: For in all our Actions betwixt Man and Man, both Publick and Private, if we obſerve that Golden Rule, to do as we would be done by, we cannot err: And if my Conſcience ſhould tell me that I tranſgreſs'd that Law when I give my Vote to baniſh the Papiſts I'll aſſure you I would not violate either that Rule or my Conſcience; I would now be ſilent, and give my Vote the other way.</p>
            <p>But that Rule does not ſo ſtrictly tye us up, as that we muſt forget our ſelves, our Poſterity, our Laws, or our Religion, it does not oblige any Man to hurt himſelf to ſave another; neither does it require that a whole Kingdom ſhall be loſt to ſave particular Men: For Charity begins at home; but when the Papiſts are conſidered in their Principles and Practices, then let any Man deny if he can, that the Papiſts themſelves are not the cauſe of whatever happens to them.</p>
            <p>I will mention but one or two of their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, becauſe I doubt not but every Gentleman here is very well informed of them.</p>
            <pb n="134" facs="tcp:58538:77"/>
            <p>The firſt that I will ſpeak to is this, That Faith is not to be kept with Hereticks: And this Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty extends to every thing, both as to Religion, and Worldly Affairs: It's the ſame thing to them whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſpeak Truth or no when they have to do with a Heretick, as they eſteem every Man that is not of their Faith, ſo that you cannot tell when to believe them, nay, though they ſwear it, for to Equivocate is a great part of their Religion.</p>
            <p>The next is this, That it is meritorious to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their Religion, without regard had to the way or means of effecting it; though it be by But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chering their King, Murthering Father or Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, proſtituting their Wife, or overthrowing the Government: Be it never ſo unnatural or repugnant to Gods Commands, and agreeable to theſe two are all the reſt of their Principles: So that I would fain ſee how it is poſſible to live in quiet with a People whoſe Religion obliges them to deſtroy all Converſe or Humane Society, to Murther their Neighbours, Aſſaſſinate their King, and Subvert the Government when it is in their Power; for my part I cannot ſee how they can or are fit to live, but with People of their own Faith and belief: Brutes and Chriſtians can never live and Converſe together; for none but Men of their Principles can live in ſafety with them.</p>
            <p>And agreeable to their Principles has been their Practice all along: What Rebellion, or to uſe their own word, Commotions have we had, but their hand has been chiefly in it: I know they would caſt the Odium of the late Wars upon the Presbyterians, they may well be afforded to lye for their Cauſe, who will do every thing elſe for it, though never ſo Inhumane or Unnatural; they
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:58538:77"/>may well deny that Plot, when they have the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence to deny this, and to caſt this alſo upon the Presbyterians; but why ſhould they not lye in theſe caſes, whoſe Religion is a Lye: But it's very well known who began the Late War, there is no Man but is ſenſible that the Papiſts carryed on the buſineſs againſt the <hi>Scots:</hi> It is too notorious that a great Woman imployed her Agents to the Papiſts, to incourage them to contribute to that Work: I'll not name her, becauſe of the Act of Oblivion, and beſides She is dead: I believe every one knows who I mean.</p>
            <p>The Papiſts have renounced the Government, they have forfeited the Benefit they might have by the Laws, in that they will not take the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, or when they do ſwallow them, it is with ſuch Mental Evaſions, that they don't think themſelves to be obliged or bound by them, which in effect is a denying them; and what are theſe two Oaths, but a reaſonable Security that the Government requires them and all others to give; and he that denyes to aſſure the Government that, he will to the beſt of his power maintain it, does in plain Engliſh acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge another power, and that when he has an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity he will do his beſt to deſtroy this, and bring in that: Is that Government obliged to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them, who will deſtroy it? Are they to have any benefit of the Laws, who will not obey them? They have renounced the Government, they have denyed the Kings Authority, and therefore they are to be uſed as Enemies to both; and then what ſeverity is it to baniſh ſuch People?</p>
            <pb n="136" facs="tcp:58538:78"/>
            <p>For what muſt we do? It's plain that whileſt they are here we ſhall never be in quiet; there is ſomething in their Religion that obliges them to be unquiet; for what reaſon had they at this time to plot or diſturb us, had not they all things at Hearts-eaſe; they cannot expect to be in ſo good a condition if they had a Prince of their own choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; they were free from all chargeable and troubleſome Imployments and Offices, their Eſtates were not burdened with the Forfeitures due by Law, an eaſie hand was layed upon them, and the way to preferment was by being of their Religion, they had got into almoſt all the profitable Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they were above, and we below; they had what they deſired, and yet all this would not do.</p>
            <p>But if this be too much, then let us do with them as the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did with the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> they had made a League with them, that they ſhould live amongſt them, but leaſt they might do them harm: They made them Hewers of Wood and Drawers of Water, <hi>Joſhua</hi> 9. notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the League: And if the Papiſts muſt live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, let us give their Eſtates to the King to eaſe our own, and reduce them to ſuch a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that ſince they will not live at peace with us, let us put it out of their power to hurt us.</p>
            <p>If they muſt live amongſt us, and have their Eſtates, I ſhall humbly propoſe that we may know them, let them wear a particular Habit, or carry ſome Mark whereby they may be diſtinguiſh't from the reſt of the Nation: In <hi>Rome</hi> the Whores wear a peculiar Garb: In the time of a Plague we ſet a Mark upon the Houſe that is Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; and ſhall theſe People have none, who are
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:58538:78"/>the Peſt of the Land, it's to them that we owe all our Diſquiet; and let us know how to avoid them: I cannot think of any other way how to be ſecure againſt them; we have no great benefit by convicting of them; kiſſing goes ſo much by favour, and they are ſo tender a place that this Man and the other is pickt out to be exempted from the Penalty of the Law, there is ſuch Picking, that few are left: Theſe are my Thoughts, and if any thing I have propoſed may be of uſe, I am very glad of it; if not, I hope I ſhall have your Pardon for troubling of you.</p>

            <p>THere is not under the Sun a better (if ſo good) a Government as ours: But the beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Government in the World is ſubject to one great fatality, and that is, whatever benefit we have by the Laws, at leaſt moſt of the Priviledges we enjoy by it, depend upon the Will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of thoſe who are to ſee to the execution of the Laws: For Laws that are not put in execution are vain and empty things, ſignifying nothing; for Execution is the Life of the Law, and without that they are a dead Letter: Laws unexecuted are not far unlike to a Gun which if rightly uſed is a Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon of great defence, but otherwiſe of no great uſe, and if it be charged, it may do much miſchief, unleſs it be levelled at the right mark: So our Laws, if they are not executed, what advantage ariſes to us more than from a waſt paper? And if they are made uſe of, yet if they are not directed to their proper end, they may hurt thoſe they ought not: So that it is out of doubt that they who
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:58538:79"/>are intruſted with the execution of the Laws; it is an indiſpenſable duty incumbent on them, that they take care not only that the Laws be duly put in execution, but alſo that they purſue their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end and deſign, in ſhort, that neither the Innocent be condemned, nor the guilty acquitted; Therefore the execution of the Law is ſo clear and undoubted a right of every Subject, that no power whatever can diſpenſe with it: And they whoſe Duty it is to ſee it done; if they either pervert or hinder the Law from having its courſe, are highly criminal, and ought to be called to a ſtrict account about it.</p>
            <p>Having ſaid this, I will in the firſt place tell you ſomething of the Law in this caſe, and next give you ſome account of the practice of our Judges and other Officers of Juſtice, and then let any Man ſay if he can, whether the Nation at this day has not great cauſe to complain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Currat Lex, Fiat Juſtitia,</hi> is the Life and end of our Government, and when the Law has not its Courſe, and Juſtice is not done, then there is a diſſolution of it: And he that will peruſe my Lord <hi>Cooks</hi> Expoſition upon <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> ſhall find that it is a Fundamental and Ancient Right of the Subject that Juſtice is not to be delayed or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond part of my Lord <hi>Cooks</hi> Inſtitutes, the 11th chap. on <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> he tells us, leſt any Party that hath right ſhould be without reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or that there ſhould be a failure of Juſtice, therefore Statutes are always ſo to be expounded, that there ſhould be no failure of Juſtice, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than that ſhould fall out, that Caſe (by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction) ſhould be excepted out of the Statute.</p>
            <pb n="140" facs="tcp:58538:80"/>
            <p>In the 29th Chap on <hi>Magna Charta, Nulli negabimus aut differemus Juſtitiam vel ratum,</hi> and that by no means, Common Right, or Common Law ſhould be diſturbed, or delayed, no, though it be commanded under the Great Seal, or by any Command whatſoever, either from the Ring, or any other, and this is backt or ſeconded by a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute made the Second of <hi>Edw.</hi> III. <hi>chap.</hi> 8. which ſays thus, <hi>That it ſhall not be commanded by the Great Seal, nor the Little Seal to diſturb or delay Common Right:</hi> And though ſuch Commandments do come, the Juſtices ſhall not therefore leave to do Right in any point.</p>
            <p>In his 2d <hi>Chap.</hi> on the Statute of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> he calls Delay the great Enemy to Juſtice: In his 24th <hi>Chap.</hi> on <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> 2d. <hi>Ne querentes recede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent a curia ſine remedio:</hi> And that is ſupported by a Statute made the 13th of <hi>Edw.</hi> I. <hi>Chap.</hi> 50. where it tells us that no Man ſhall depart from the Kings Court without remedy.</p>
            <p>In the 25th <hi>Chap.</hi> on <hi>Weſtm.</hi> 2d. <hi>Dominus Rex Voluntatem habens ut celeris fiat Juſtitia:</hi> And the reaſon hereof is given, for <hi>Expedit Reipublicae ut ſit finis litium.</hi>

            <p>And by a Statute made the 9th of <hi>Hen.</hi> III. <hi>ch.</hi> 29.

Has not Juſtice been Sold, and perverted; Witneſs the Acquittal of Sir <hi>George Wakeman,</hi> Sir <hi>Tho.

            <p>It's ſo long ſince K. <hi>Alfreds</hi> time, that poſſibly what was then done is out of their thoughts; for my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> in the third part of his <hi>Inſtitutes, chap.</hi> 101, makes mention of a great many Judges who were hanged in one year for falſe Judgment in K. <hi>Alfreds</hi> time, and if we look into the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a corrupt Judge, which is recited by him in the 224 <hi>page,</hi> it might be ſufficient to deter any Judge (who has either any Chriſtianity or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality) from offending in the diſcharge of his truſt; but it may be ſome wonder that they have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten what happen'd in the 24th of <hi>Edw.</hi> III. concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>William Thorp</hi> Chief Juſtice, what a ſevere puniſhment he underwent for Bribery; all which may be ſeen at large in <hi>page</hi> 223, 3d <hi>Part.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:58538:81"/>ſo that of <hi>Treſilian</hi> and <hi>Belknarp,</hi> with others their Fellows who were all Attainted by Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 2d of <hi>Richard</hi> II. which was afterward confirmed by the 1ſt of <hi>Hen.</hi> IV. A Man would think that theſe cannot be forgotten; but as the caſe ſtands, their Memories are to be refreſht by condign puniſhment, and they very well deſerve it; for my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> in the fourth part of his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes,</hi> ſays, <hi>chap.</hi> 13. That when particular Courts fail of Juſtice, the General Courts ſhall give remedy: <hi>Ne curiae Regis deficerent in Juſtitia exhibenda:</hi> So that what a condition are we in when thoſe Judges that are to relieve againſt the injuſtice or delay of Inferiour Courts; do turn Merchants of the Law, and will not do right; for when they are corrupt, how ſhall we eſcape, but all Inferiour Courts will follow their Example; therefore in my opinion this Matter ought to be ſearcht into; and if there prove ſuch faults as are complained of, we can do no Ieſs but puniſh the Offenders, and prevent the like for the future, leaſt we otherwiſe ſeem to countenance their actions; for if we do not puniſh them, we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of them: From which, Good Lord deliver us.</p>
            <p>And now I am ſpeaking of Judges and their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>behaviour, give me leave to acquaint you with the grievance of the County for which I ſerve in relation to our Judge or Chief Juſtice:</p>
            <p>The County for which I ſerve is <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> which is a County Palatine, and we have two Judges peculiarly aſſign'd us by His Majeſty: Our Puiſne Judge I have nothing to ſay againſt him, for he is a very honeſt Man for ought I know:</p>
            <pb n="143" facs="tcp:58538:81"/>
            <p>But I cannot be ſilent as to our Chief Judge, and I will name him, becauſe what I have to ſay, will appear more probable: His Name is Sir <hi>George Jefferies,</hi> who I muſt ſay behaved himſelf more like a <hi>Jack-Pudding,</hi> than with that gravity that beſeems a Judge; He was mighty Witty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Priſoners at the Bar, he was very full of his Joaks upon People that came to give Evidence; not ſuffering them to declare what they had to ſay in their own way and method, but would interrupt them, becauſe they behaved themſelves with more gravity than he; and in truth, the People were ſtrangely perplexed when they were to give in their Evidence; but I do not inſiſt upon this, nor upon the late Hours he kept up and down our City; It's ſaid he was every Night drinking till Two a Clock, or beyond that time, and that he went to his Chamber drunk; but this I have only by Common Fame; for I was not in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; I bleſs God I am not a Man of his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or Behaviour; but in the Mornings he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd with the Symptoms of a Man that over Night had taken a large Cup.</p>
            <p>But that which I have to ſay is the Complaint of every Man, eſpecially of them who had any Law Suits. Our Chief Juſtice has a very Arbitrary Power, in appointing the Aſſize when he pleaſes; and this Man has ſtrained it to the higheſt point; For whereas we were accuſtomed to have Two Aſſizes, the firſt about <hi>April</hi> or <hi>May,</hi> the latter about <hi>September;</hi> It was this Year, the middle (as I remember) of <hi>Auguſt</hi> before we had any Aſſize; and then he diſpatcht buſineſs ſo well, that he left half the Cauſes untryed, and to help the matter, has reſolved that we ſhall have no more Aſſizes this Year.</p>
            <pb n="144" facs="tcp:58538:82"/>
            <p>Theſe things I hope are juſt cauſe of Complaint: It cannot be ſuppoſed that People can with eaſe or delight be in expectation ſo long as from <hi>May</hi> till <hi>Auguſt</hi> to have their Cauſes determined; for the notice he gave was very ſhort and uncertain.</p>
            <p>And I beg you is it not hard for them that had any Tryals; to ſee Councel, be at the charge of bringing Witneſſes, and keep them there five or ſix days; to ſpend their Time and Money, and neglect their Affairs at home; and when all is done, go back and not have their Cauſes heard: This was the caſe of moſt People the laſt Aſſize.</p>

            <p>THE greateſt part of the misfortunes which befall mankind would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, did they but keep in mind and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſider, the moſt remarkable things which happen to them; for then they would not (as is every day ſeen) neglect ſo many advantageous opportunities which by Providence is put into their hands, nor ſplit ſo often upon the ſame Rock. For ſo apt are men to forget even things of the the greateſt moment, that it is become a common ſaying, That there is not any thing that is more than a nine days wonder: which does ſufficiently expreſs the giddineſs and want of conſideration in Men: Of which there never was a more pregnant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, than is to be obſerved in <hi>England</hi> at this time: For tho the late Revolution was as remarkable as any thing could be, both for the matter as well as for the manner of it, yet it ſeems to be as much out of peoples thoughts, as if no ſuch thing had happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us.</p>
            <pb n="354" facs="tcp:58538:83"/>
            <p>It is a great unhappineſs that no more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice is taken of it, and it would yet be a greater misfortune, if we make no more advantage of it, than yet we have done: and ſince it does ſo much concern us to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it in our thoughts, I hope I ſhall not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend your time, whilſt I give you a ſhort account of the occaſion that ſent K. <hi>J.</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and for what reaſon his preſent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, the then Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> was placed on the Throne.</p>
            <p>I believe you may remember how much the greater part of the Nation was alarm'd, when it was known that the Duke of <hi>York</hi> had declared himſelf a Papiſt, by reaſon of the fatal effects it would have upon our Religion and Liberty, if in caſe he ſhould come to the Crown: And the Parliament being no leſs ſenſible of this threatning danger, made ſeveral attempts to exclude him from the Crown by Act of Parliament; which was the cauſe wherefore ſo many Parliaments one on the neck of another, in the latter end of <hi>Charles</hi> the ll. <hi>'s</hi> time proved Abortive, for when the Court could not by any other Artifice keep off the Bill of Excluſion, that Parliament was diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and another called, in hopes to find it of another temper; but perceiving that every Parliament began where the other left off of that Scent, King <hi>Charles</hi> took leave of Parliaments for the reſt of his time: And then all thoſe who had been for the Bill of Excluſion, were loaded with all manner of reproaches, and amongſt other
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:58538:83"/>things were called Anti-Monarch-men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would break into the Succeſſion, for that the Excluſion of the Duke of <hi>York</hi> was uſed only as a pretence to bring in a Common-wealth: To ſuch a degree of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs did the miſtaken Loyalty of ſome people carry them: And I wiſh there were not ſome at this day, who hope to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves welcome at Court, by calling every thing Anti-Monarchical that is propoſed for the good of the Nation.</p>
            <p>At laſt things being in a poſture for the purpoſe, <hi>C.</hi> II. went off (but how is not yet certain) to make room for his Brother the Duke of <hi>York;</hi> who began very early to diſcover himſelf, and in a ſhort time had made ſo very bold with matters both in Church and State, as to demonſtrate that the apprehenſions of thoſe who would have Excluded him, was rather a Propheſie of what he would do, than a groundleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture; for his power ſwelled ſo faſt, that he quickly makes all people to feel the intollerable burden of an unbounded Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative; ſo that many who before fell down and worſhipt Prerogative, were than as haſty to get out of the way of it, as they would to avoid a Monſter that ſtood ready to devour them; and thereby brought them ſo far to their Wits, as to enable them to ſee, that it is much ſafer to truſt the Law, than the King's Will and Pleaſure with their Liberties and Properties: and that God had no more given Kings a right to oppreſs and inſlave their Subjects, than he
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:58538:84"/>had indued them with a power to Create Men. For the method which King <hi>James</hi> took, ſhewed plainly to all the world, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than being Abſolute would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent him; That is, he would govern by his Will, and force an obedience to his pleaſure by his Army; for his Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion became more exorbitant every day than other, till his preſent Majeſty, the then Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> Landed; who as is uſual upon ſuch occaſions, ſet out a Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the occaſion that brought him hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wherein is innumerated many of the irregularities of King <hi>James</hi> his Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing mentioned is the Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing-power, which King <hi>James</hi> had aſſumed, whereby he gave juſt occaſion for a very loud complaint, becauſe it is a moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Inſtrument in the hand of any King, for it not only makes a noiſe, but does certain execution; it ſwallows up Law where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it comes, and tears up Liberty and Property by the Roots; it does not only put every mans right at uncertainty, but makes it uncertain whether there is any ſuch thing as Right; it is of ſo diffuſive a Nature, that if it be exerciſed in one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the next that is governed by the ſame King has cauſe to think it ſelf in danger.</p>
            <p>This the Parliament had early under their conſideration, and prepared a Bill, for taking away the Diſpenſing-power, which by the help of ſome other things that were in the ſame Bill, obtained the Royal Aſſent, and ſo it paſſed into a Law.</p>
            <pb n="357" facs="tcp:58538:84"/>
            <p>The Declaration then takes notice, that for the better introducing of the Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing-power, That the Judges were prevailed with to declare that ſuch a power is a right belonging to the Crown, and in order to it, the Judges opinions were diſcovered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand; and ſuch as would not comply were turned out, thereby to intimate to the reſt that they might act at all times as they ſhould be directed.</p>
            <p>This indeed was a very high aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it; this was not to uſe the Law law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, but to eſtabliſh Oppreſſion, Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and all manner of Iniquity by a Law: For whoever ſhall endeavour to influence the Judges in their opinions, by what means ſoever he ſeeks to intimidate them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be by turning them out of their places, withholding their Sallaries, or put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting others over their Heads, does plainly diſcover, that he aims at nothing leſs than to Govern by his Will: For the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of loſing a good imploy is not above the ordinary rate of men, and the ſtopping of a Judges Sallary muſt have the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, becauſe it's all one, whether a man is turned out of his place, or the profits of it are withholden from him: and that Judge is expoſed to a powerful temptation, who ſees he cannot riſe in courſe, unleſs he will comply.</p>
            <p>The Parliament being ſenſible how much the Juſtice of the Nation lay expoſed, ſo long as the Judges held their Places or Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries at Pleaſure, had the laſt Seſſions but
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:58538:85"/>one, prepared a Bill to remedy this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience; which was offered to the Royal Aſſent, but was refuſed; for what reaſons is not proper for me to give, becauſe I ſhall always adviſe the contrary: ſo that that part of King <hi>James</hi>'s Male-adminiſtration remains as it was, to be practiſed by any other King, who ſhall be ſo wicked as to have it in his thoughts, how he may inſlave the Nation.</p>
            <p>The Declaration obſerves that King <hi>James</hi> put men into imployment, and continued them therein, altho they had not qualified themſelves according to Law.</p>
            <p>This, as it unhinged one of the great ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities of the Government, ſo it was a plain indication of King <hi>James</hi>'s intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to govern without Law: for when men are put into imployment in ſpight of the Law, it ſhews they were preferred not ſo much for their fitneſs to execute that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as to ſerve ſome other purpoſe againſt Law; and thoſe that ſo complyed, juſtly incurred the cenſure of every man that wiſht well to his Country; for they ſhewed that they were through-ſtich-men, that would ſtick at nothing, thereby rendering themſelves ſo infamous as to make all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind conclude that they would never be imployed in any other Reign, by reaſon of the ſcandal, as well as the danger that any Prince runs, who ſhall take them into his Service.</p>
            <pb n="359" facs="tcp:58538:85"/>
            <p>The Declaration then takes notice of the Eccleſiaſtical Commiſſion; which indeed car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried an ill deſign in the face of it, it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been always found, that ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary methods are not ſo much to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh faults already committed, as to wiſh there were ſuch, and to pretend men to be guilty, who have not tranſgreſſed. For if nothing more had been deſigned, but to puniſh thoſe who really were offenders, what need was there of that High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, ſeeing the Law had before ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently provided; ſo that the parlous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of ſetting up that Commiſſion was very obvious, and it was yet plainer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was expreſly againſt Law, for 16 <hi>Car.</hi> c. 11. that took away the then High-Commiſſion Court, has provided and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that any other ſuch like Court is illegal, and all proceedings thereupon to be void, and of no force.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot but obſerve to you, how far they were the occaſion of ſetting up this Court, who were like to ſuffer moſt by it: For it cannot be forgot what pains the Clergy took to magnifie Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, and to preach up the Doctrine of Paſſive-Obedience, and Non-reſiſtance; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which King <hi>James</hi> ſuppoſing them to be worthy of their Functions, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what they preacht in their Pulpits, they would practice when they were out of them, thought he might make the more bold with them: But with what Chriſtian patience they bore it, I believe you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:58538:86"/>for King <hi>James</hi> received more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful language and revilings from them than from all other people: and therefore I hope they have learnt this leſſon, and will be careful for the future to inſtruct all others under their care, not to extend Prerogative beyond the bounds which the Law has ſet it, leſt they are the firſt that feel the weight of an unlimited power: For this Eccleſiaſtical-Commiſſion was a monſtrous thing; and therefore it is to be hoped, that all thoſe who were of it, and that now are in eminent ſtations under this Government, have made it appear that they are become new men: or otherwiſe if it was a fault in King <hi>James</hi> to ſet up that Commiſſion, it will be hard to find an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for their being of it.</p>
            <p>The Declaration proceeds, in taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that ſeveral Churches and Chapels were built for the exerciſe of the <hi>Romiſh Religion,</hi> and that ſeveral Colleges of Jeſuits were ſet up, and that a Jeſuit was made one of King <hi>James</hi>'s Privy Council.</p>
            <p>This, had it ſtood ſingly of it ſelf, muſt appear dreadful to all true <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> and yet it was but a neceſſary conſequence of what went before it, and gave every man a clearer proſpect of the precarious condition in which his Religion and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſtood.</p>
            <p>The next thing that followed was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine Lord Lieutenants and Deputy Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants, Juſtices of the Peace, and all others in publick imployments, in order to have
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:58538:86"/>the Penal-Laws and Teſt repealed; and to turn out ſuch as would not concur. This was made uſe of (as no doubt it would have been) a very effectual means towards the packing of a Parliament, it being a leſſon which he had learnt from his Brother <hi>C.</hi> II. who uſed to take Parliament-men to task in private, where he uſed ſuch argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as thereby he ſo often drew from the Parliament thoſe unneceſſary ſupplies. This examination of the People in private, was called Cloſetting, at firſt lookt upon as a very inconſiderable thing, yet we ſaw that the ſaid Cloud, tho at firſt no bigger than a mans hand, quickly overſpread the whole Heavens, and gave our affairs a very gloomy Complexion, and if we will learn, has taught us this uſeful leſſon; That, when men ſhall not be left to the freedom of their judgments in relation to the publick, but indeavours are uſed to warp and bend them another way, that there is ſome ill deſign in hatching; eſpecially when ſuch applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are made to members of Parliament, concerning ſuch matters as are under their Conſideration: For this is to kill the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment at the Root, and the deſign is equally apparent and miſchievous, by what means ſoever a Parliament is corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether it be by Places, Penſions, or any other thing that makes the Members thereof to become men of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance.</p>
            <pb n="362" facs="tcp:58538:87"/>
            <p>The next Article againſt K. <hi>J.</hi> is that he Seized upon the Charters of Corporations, thereby bringing their Priviledges to be diſpoſed on at his will and pleaſure</p>
            <p>This was very Notable Injuſtice, yet the making havock of Charters was begun and carried on very far by <hi>C.</hi> II. to which the Loyalty that then prevail'd contributed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much; for who ever was not for ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of Charters and giving up their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, was mark'd out as Anti-Monarchical and a Commonwealths-Man, and this fantaſtical Loyalty had intoxicated ſo very many, that very few Corporations ſtood out; thoſe that diſputed the point were taught the Law of <hi>Quo Warrento.</hi> So that when K. <hi>C.</hi> died he left his brother little more to do than to give the finiſhing ſtroke to that he had brought to ſo great Perfection: by which we ſee how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous it is to make any other thing, than the Law the Meaſure of our Loyalty; for altho at firſt no ill conſequence may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended of what is done, yet it is not long e're Men find their miſtake, by the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief which falls upon their own Pates, and with this aggravation, that they don't ſee their error till it is out of their power to remedy it.</p>
            <p>The Declaration next obſerves, how that <hi>Ireland</hi> was put into the hands of Papiſts, which made many to leave the Country, well remembring what fell out in the year 41.</p>
            <p>This was very true, and it is as true, that it put every Man in <hi>England</hi> (who valued his Religion and Property) under very
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:58538:87"/>great fears and apprehenſions that the ſtorm would blow over into <hi>England.</hi> Becauſe he that would ſet up Aarbitrary-Power in <hi>England,</hi> muſt firſt try his hand upon <hi>Ireland;</hi> it having been obſerv'd, that whatever Arbitrary thing has been done in <hi>England,</hi> that it has firſt been practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in <hi>Ireland.</hi> So that when ever things go irregularly in <hi>Ireland, England</hi> cannot think it ſelf ſafe, till affairs are put into a better poſture there.</p>
            <p>The Declaration further takes notice, that K. <hi>J.</hi> had declared in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that all his Subjects are bound to obey him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſerve. This is the higheſt of abſolute Power, and it was plain he intended to do no leſs in <hi>England;</hi> For there is nothing more certain in humane Affairs, Than that when a K. miſ-imploys his power in one Kingdom, it is not for want of inclination, but of means and opportunity, that he does not do ſo in all other places under his Dominion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> As for Example, if a King keep one of his Kingdoms without Parliaments, he would do ſo in another, if by ſome neceſſity he were not compell'd to do otherwiſe; for <hi>C.</hi> II. kept <hi>Ireland</hi> without Parliaments, and it was out of regard to his particular Affairs, that he called a Parliament in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for you may remember how quickly he ſent the Parliament packing that called him in, becauſe it was more intent upon ſetling the Nation, than to give him unneceſſary ſupplies; and thoſe which he afterwards called, were kept no longer than he could ſqueeze Money out of them.</p>
            <pb n="364" facs="tcp:58538:88"/>
            <p>The Declaration goes on to remind us how K. <hi>J.</hi> indeavour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d to diſcourage and take away from the Subject the right of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning. The priviledge of Petitioning is an ancient and neceſſary right, and ſo great a right, as it has always been ſuppoſed, that upon ſuch applications, the K. was bound either to redreſs that whereof they complain'd, or to let them ſee, that their complaint was without cauſe. But to take away this right from the people, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive them of the means of making known their grievances in the moſt humble and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful way that can be, and puts them under a neceſſity of doing it with their Swords in their hands; for there is but one of theſe two ways of letting the K. know their grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances: there is nothing more fit, than that Subjects, tho' never ſo much oppreſt, do firſt make known their ſufferings, in the humbleſt and moſt reſpectful manner that may be, and not have recourſe to more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive methods, till no good is to be done the other way: That Prince who is unwilling to hear the complaints of his People plainly intimates, that he intends to govern them by the rod of his power, and not by the equal and gentle methods of the Law: and there ſeems to be no leſs a fearful expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, when the addreſſes of both or either Houſe of Parliament, don't meet with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, but prove abortive; for conſidering that the Nation does then Petition the K. in its higheſt Capacity, it may reaſonably be
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:58538:88"/>expected, that thoſe applications ſhould be anſwered with effect, unleſs the K. be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer than all the World, and ſuch a Man was never yet found, or elſe what the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment complains of is falſe or frivilous, which is not eaſily to be ſuppos'd.</p>
            <p>Then the Declaration reminds as of K. <hi>James</hi>'s deſign to pack a Parliament, that by the Peoples conſent, thoſe things might be made a Law, which he had done contrary to the right of the People and the Law of the Land: which was to ſtab the Nation to the Heart. For a Parliament is the Soveraign and only remedy for publick Diſtempers, and if rightly, apply'd works an infallible Cure, but if it be corrupted makes the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady, how ſlight or inconſiderable ſoever, to become Incurable. He that deſires to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt a Parliament, leaves very little room to believe that the good of his people is the end of his Government: for when a Prince looks upon it to be his Intreſt to influence and byaſs the Parliament, he cannot be thought to have ſome Intereſt with his People. There are two ways to corrupt a Parliament: The firſt is to influence the Elections, ſo as to have Men choſen that will ſerve a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular purpoſe and deſign; and 2dly, if that fail, to corrupt the Members by Places, Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, or good round ſums of Money, which is called Secret Service, whereby the Nation becomes <hi>felo de ſe</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The laſt article againſt K. <hi>J.</hi> is that of impoſing upon us a Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi> This indeed, if it were ſo, is as great a Forgery
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:58538:89"/>and Cheat as ever was heard of: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe whom it more nearly concerns have not yet thought fit to inquire further into it, I ſuppoſe it will not be expected that I ſhould give any opinion of it at this time.</p>
            <p>This is the ſubſtance of the charge brought by the P. <hi>Orange</hi> againſt K. <hi>J.</hi> I think I have not omitted any thing that is material: but theſe are not all the irregularites that K. <hi>J.</hi> was guilty of; yet are they ſufficient to ſhew that his adminiſtration was inconſiſtent with the Rights and Liberties of <hi>Engliſh</hi>-Men, and who is he that can imagin that there was any other means but force whereby we could recover our Rights; they that think it could have been effected by gentler applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, may as well pretend to bind the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viathan</hi> with Cords: Thoſe that have boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt of Prayers and Tears, when they have been touch'd by Arbritrary Power, have found thoſe things to be of no more force with a Prince that had will and means to be Arbitrary, than the Cords on <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Arms, and then have they been very willing to make uſe of more violent applications. For thoſe who value themſelves moſt upon this ſort of Loyalty, are generally ſuch as are unconcern'd for the publick, provided they can make themſelves ſafe; and may well be compar'd to the Fox in the Fable, who having loſt his Tail would have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the reſt to cut off theirs. They that will not lift up their hand to ſave their Country, are as much to be condemned as the
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:58538:89"/>Inhabitants of <hi>Meroz,</hi> who were curs'd bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly becauſe they came not to the help of Lord againſt the Mighty, <hi>Judges</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 23.</p>
            <p>K. <hi>J.</hi> had ſo disjointed and made ſuch ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock of the Government, that the firſt ſtep towards the repairing our breaches was to lay him aſide, not out of any particular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to his Perſon but to his actions, becauſe what he had done was not to be ſuffer'd in any other Man, for whoever ſhall hereafter do the like muſt expect the ſame meaſure.</p>
            <p>K. <hi>J.</hi> being deem'd unmeet to ſway the Scepter the next thing was to conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was better to turn the adminiſtration into a Regency, or clſe to elect another in the Room of K. <hi>J.</hi> and after ſome time ſpent therein, it was reſolv'd, as the beſt, to place ſome other on the Throne; becauſe as that did make the leaſt alteration that could be, ſo whatever was amiſs in the State would more eaſily be rectified, than by another Method that was propoſed: Upon this give me leave to make one obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; That altho' a Regency and a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth are the ſame in effect, being but ſeveral Names for the ſame thing, yet there prevails an opinion, where one would leaſt ſuſpect it: That thoſe who were for a Regency are the only men for Monarchy, and that thoſe who were for continuing the Adminiſtration under a King, are for a Common-wealth; how this opinion can be conſiſtent with it ſelf I do not apprehend, unleſs that whatever is done for the good of the people, brings us ſo
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:58538:90"/>much nearer to a Common-wealth; and if ſo, Kings will find it to be their intereſt, as well as their duty to make their Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration eaſie to the people.</p>
            <p>It being reſolved to fill the Vacant Throne, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was preſently thought on, as the fitteſt of all others for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, not ſo much for having been the chief inſtrument of our deliverance, tho a great deal was due to him from the Nation in point of gratitude.</p>
            <p>But the Crown was offered to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> in hopes of having the effect of his Declaration; for as it was his intereſt to perform what he had therein ſaid and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, ſo the Nation was more likely to obtain a full redreſs of its grievances by him, than by any other, for he had the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of King <hi>James</hi> freſh before him, he could not but very well apprehend that what could not be indured in King <hi>James,</hi> would not be ſuffered in any other; he knew very well that the Nation expected to have his Declaration made good to the full, as well becauſe he had promiſed, as alſo becauſe of the right they had to have their greivances redreſſed: and that ſo far or ſo long as any part of it was denyed or delayed, ſo far would the people be diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and think themſelves deceived: He could not but be ſenſible of the reproach and hazard he ran, that having found fault with King <hi>James</hi>'s Adminiſtration, if he did not amend whatever was amiſs; and that to trifle with the Nation in any one particular,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:58538:90"/>would render all the reſt ſuſpected of what he had ſaid or promiſed.</p>
            <p>He told us in his Declaration, that the greatneſs and ſecurity both of Kings, Royal Families, and of all ſuch as are in authority, as well as the happineſs of their Subjects and People, depend, in a moſt eſpecial manner, upon the exact obſervation and maintenance of their Laws, Liberties and Cuſtoms.</p>
            <p>This, ſo true a principle, that he who governs accordingly cannot fail to proſper in all he puts his hand unto; and he that ſays ſo, and knows and underſtands what he ſays, yet does not act accordingly, cannot expect the love of his people.</p>
            <p>He was very ſenſible how diſtaſtful a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Army is to the Nation, and much more when a conſiderable part of it is comopſed of Foreigners; and that to increaſe the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Foreign Troops would very much alarm the Nation, unleſs it was by reaſon of ſcarcity of our own people, or want of ſuch as durſt fight, or for ſome ſuch neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; and therefore to remove thoſe appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, he promiſes to ſend back all the Foreign Forces he had brought along with him, as ſoon as the State of the Nation will admit of it.</p>
            <p>He promiſed to bring <hi>Ireland</hi> to ſuch a ſtate, as that the Proteſtants and Britiſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt may be there ſecured, conſidering, no doubt, that as <hi>Ireland</hi> is the backdoor to <hi>England,</hi> he could not be thought to be in earneſt as to the good of <hi>England,</hi> ſo long as he neglected the ſettlement of that other
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:58538:91"/>Kingdom; becauſe <hi>England</hi> can never reckon it ſelf ſafe, ſo long as things are out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der there, having reaſon to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſpect that the irregularities in the Adminiſtration in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> will ſooner or later affect <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, He promiſes to concur in every thing that may procure the Peace and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Nation, which a free and lawful Parliament ſhall determine; ſo that there may be no more danger of the Nations falling at any time here after, under Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>When the State is diſtempered, a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſo abſolutely neceſſary, that it is ſcarce poſſible to cure it, without one; but then that Parliament muſt be a free and lawful one: as well in the manner of electing it, as afterwards in their proceeding, for if there be any foul play, or underhand pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in the Elections, or that when the Members come together, they are over awed, or corrupted, this may have the name, but nothing of the nature of a free and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Parliment, and is like Phyſick ill prepared or applyed, does more hurt than good. In curing the diſtempers of the Government ſuch reformation muſt be intire without any reſerve; for if any gap is left, it will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let in as many irregularities as were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore complained of: for unleſs the very root and foundation of thoſe diſtempers be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, it will prove no better than the skinning over of a Sore, which whilſt it ſeems fair to the eye, is feſtring within, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards breaks out with greater Violence.</p>
            <pb n="371" facs="tcp:58538:91"/>
            <p>Upon a Revolution, where the Government is Monarchical, one of theſe things uſually happens, either that the King is continued in the Throne upon a new ſtipulation or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract between him and the people, or elſe the Adminiſtration is put under a Regency; or the King being found unmeet to ſway the Scepter, is therefore laid aſide, and another choſen into his place; or elſe the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is changed into a Commonwealth.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe, that is, when the King by a new agreement is continued to Reign, is the eaſieſt and ſureſt come at, becauſe the irregularities in ſuch a caſe are not many, ſo that remedies are as obvious as the grievances are ſenſible: and the King, finding what it is to provoke the Nation, readily complies with whatever is propoſed, leſt he ſhould make the people deſperate; and there is this farther in the caſe, that being jealous of the King's intentions, the people no longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon his Word and Promiſes, but take care to have effectual remedies.</p>
            <p>As to the ſecond thing, that is a Regency, this is a kind of a myſterious thing, for the King, is neither altogether Depoſed, nor does he Govern; but the Adminiſtration is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to another, who in nature of a Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian does all in his name, yet under the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey, and ſubject to the Controul of the two Houſes of Parliament. But this ſeldom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, for either the King is reſtrained, or the Government is changed into a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: So that this not anſwering the and propoſed, it oftentimes happens, that when
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:58538:92"/>the King is found unmeet to govern by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he is laid aſide for good and all, and another is elected in his ſtead, which is done, when his adminiſtration is become exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and that he is deaf to the Petitions and Complaints of his people: for ſuch a change is not made for the ſake of him to whom the Crown is given, but that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment may be amended. Now tho this is ſeldome done, but for very good cauſe, yet through the folly of ſome, and knavery of others, it does not often anſwer expectation. For tho there is much to do, and a great deal that is needful, yet what through the unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of thoſe who have the conduct of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and the unfair proceedings of others, who out of favour to the Depoſed King make it their buſineſs to lay rubs and difficulties is the way, and to render every thing impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, whereby the work is very often left im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect: But beſides this, tho the people have then every thing in their power, yet a very little matter takes off the dread and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of any danger, either for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent or time to come, and conſequently makes them remiſs, if not altogether to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect to make ſuch proviſions as are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and this for two reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe as ſoon as the King is depoſed the minds of the people are put at eaſe, either from a belief that all the Calamities, which befell them during his reign, proceeded di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly from himſelf, without the advice, or improvement of any other: Or elſe becauſe that no other man will be wicked to ſuch a degree as
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:58538:92"/>he was; which certainly are two very great miſtakes: For it was never yet ſeen, where the irregularities of a Reign were many, but that ſome about the King put ill thoughts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his head, or helpt to improve that which he had conceived: And in the next place he that ſucceeds is more likely to do as the other has done, than that no man will ever be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the like miſ-behaviour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe it is the nature of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to be tranſported with every change, that is with their conſent, and eſpecially in ſuch caſes as theſe, where it makes ſo great an alteration; ſo that for ſome time their conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration departs from them, and they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend ſo implicitly upon words and promiſes, as if there needed nothing more to ſettle the Nation; and then as an unavoidable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of it, the beſt conſtruction is put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all that is done, even to look upon the irregularities of the new elected Prince (if he ſhall commit any) to proceed from his care of the Publick: Nay, altho he do imploy the Miniſters and Creatures of the Depoſed King, this ſhall be imagined to ariſe from the ſame regard to the Nation, becauſe it will be ſuppoſed that he either finds, or has made them fitter than any other, to ſerve him and the publick, till the ill effects are felt of having ſuch perſons near the King. But it is not eaſily to be imagined that ſuch perſons are imployed for the ſake of the publick, unleſs their parts and abilities eminently exceed the reſt of mankind; which would be little leſs than a miracle; or elſe at leaſt that they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:58538:93"/>new men to all intents and purpoſes, and that ought to be as evident as the Sun at Noon-day.</p>
            <p>If a Prince entertain ſuch men, and knows what they are, ſuch evil Miniſters are more likely to make him a bad Prince; than that he can make them juſt and faithful Councellors, to him and the publick.</p>
            <p>If none of theſe things I have mentioned happen upon a Revolution, then there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains nothing, but to change the Government into a Commonwealth: But that is ſeldome done till the caſe is ſo deſperate as that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe will do; yet it moſt commonly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens either when the Father and Son ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively have governed Tyrannically; or elſe when one Prince is depoſed, and the next proves as bad as he; indeed unleſs it be at the laſt extremity, it ought not to be thought on; becauſe it is eaſier to repair an old Government than to make a new one; and beſides, there needs a great deal of time to bring the latter into ſhape, and eſpecially a Commonwealth, where ſo much Vertue in the people is requiſite to make and continue it ſuch; of which ſort of Government, I will only ſay, That no doubt but it has its particular excellency: for as no Government is altogether perfect, ſo every Government has ſomething that is particularly good in it.</p>
            <p>And here give me leave to ſay a word in my own vindication, I find I have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed to be a Commonwealths man, but were I permitted to ſpeak for my ſelf, I would
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:58538:93"/>ſay, That I like this Conſtitution under King, Lords and Commons better than any other, and I defie any man to mention that thing which can give juſt occaſion to think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of me; I am ſure there is no man ſo hardy as to tell me ſo to my face; yet I ſay withal, That if through the Adminiſtration of thoſe who are truſted with the Executive Power, or by any other means, my liberty ſhall become precarious, I will then be for any other form of Government, under which my Liberty and Property may be more ſecure, and till then I don't deſire to change: And in this I think I am not much in the wrong; but this only by the by.</p>
            <p>Now to apply what I have ſaid to our preſent caſe; I think King <hi>James</hi> was juſtly depoſed; for what part of the Conſtitution had not he put out of order, and then how can ſuch a man be meet to ſway the Scepter: and in the next place, as things ſtood at that time, all circumſtances conſidered, who was ſo likely to do us right, as he that had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to repair our Breaches, and whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt it was to be as good as his word; and tho we have not every thing as well as well as we could wiſh, yet that does not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from any error in placing the Crown where it is, but from ſomething elſe that could not be foreſeen, for whoever he is that judges of things only by the ſucceſs, ſhews not his wiſdom ſo much as his folly, becauſe he reckons without his Hoſt.</p>
            <pb n="376" facs="tcp:58538:94"/>
            <p>True indeed it is, that our Affairs are not proſperous, many diſaſters have befallen us; and we have let ſlip ſeveral advantages, ſuch as we can hardly hope for the like again, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with abundance of other things, that are very melancholly reflections: whether theſe have happened through the defect of our Councils or Treachery, I will only ſay, That it ought ought exemplarily to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht where ever the fault is: and be it where it will, there is one and the ſame ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal cauſe of both, and till that is removed we cannot expect it ſhould be better with us: I wiſh it were not too plain that God has a Controverſie with this Land: for which of us can ſay, that he is not juſtly provoked, ſo that if we are infatuated in our Councils, it is the hand of God that is againſt us; and if we are betrayed, is there not a cauſe.</p>
            <p>I wiſh we were fit for a better condition, and ſurely it is our own fault that it is not otherwiſe: For God has plainly ſhewn us, that he is willing to be gracious to us: Not only by bringing about the late Revolution, but alſo by multiplied inſtances ſince that, of his care and protection: for how many Fleets of our Merchants have eſcaped, by no leſs than Miracle? and by no leſs a Providence, did the French Fleet fall into our hands. How ſtrangly have ſeveral great Plots been diſcovered, juſt when they were ready to be put in execution: but notwithſtanding all this.</p>
            <pb n="377" facs="tcp:58538:94"/>
            <p>It is too obvious that our Affairs have every year gone backward, and in this much more than any of the reſt, it is to be feared that worſe remains, if it be not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by a ſpeedy and thorough Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</p>
            <p>And therefore Gentlemen, of the many things that are at this time under your care, (for whatever is an offence againſt the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Peace falls within your inquiry) I will more eſpecially recommend to your conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration theſe few things, without loſing your time by innumerating of the reſt.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, to do what in you lies, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the profanation of the holy name of God by Oaths and horrible Execrations, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much over ſpread the Land as it does in this Age: It is a moſt unaccountable thing; it can only be learnt by Converſation, and improved by Art and Induſtry, becauſe it is not a ſin of Nature, and conſequently wants that impulſe either of pleaſure or profit which leads to the commiſſion of other ſins: It is certainly a great provocation of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and does in no ſort recommend the converſation of any man; for who can take delight to hear God's name taken in vain? no man can pretend, that for being a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Swearer, the more credit is to be given to what he ſays: for how can he be thought to regard Truth, who makes ſo light of him, that is the very truth? what advantage then does any man reap by it? and ſince there is neither pleaſure nor profit by it: it is very well ſaid by one, That for other ſins men ſell
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:58538:95"/>their Souls, but for profane ſwearing they give theirs. How then can we hope for ſucceſs in our Armies, amongſt whom there is more horrible Curſing and Swearing, than is to be heard any where elſe: Whileſt they contemn God, and daily ſpit in his face, how can we hope that he will go forth with our Armies, ſo long as by their reitterated expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions they ſeem to have renounced his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, what do they look like but men that are appointed to deſtruction; were there as much care to puniſh this as there is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into falſe Muſters, and ſome other things of leſs conſideration, it would not fail to have a ſuitable effect; but this is to be done by others, your care is to look into your neighbours, and if you know of any that are common ſwearers, or of any Petty Conſtables, who have neglected to inform the <hi>J.</hi> of <hi>P.</hi> at all their monthly meetings, you ought to preſent them.</p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed, that the moſt that you can do, will go but a little way in this work for the preſent; yet it is as true that it muſt be begun at ſome time, and ſome where, and I wiſh you may have the honour to be the firſt in it; for if your example be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by others, it will redound to their everlaſting praiſe, but if it ſhould proceed no further, yet you have this ſatisfaction, that you have waſht your hands, and done your duty.</p>
            <p>The next thing is to inquire after thoſe who made light of the Sabbath, either by neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting to go to ſome publick worſhip: or
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:58538:95"/>elſe, that having been at Church both parts of the day, yet ſpend the remainder of it, in Sports or Gaming, or elſe what is more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent (and too very common) in an Ale-houſe.</p>
            <p>It is certainly a great contempt of God to neglect the means of Salvation; they that do ſo, muſt either imagine that they have no ſuch thing as a Soul, or elſe believe that it is of ſo little value, that it ought to be the leaſt part of their care: Can any man upon mature deliberation be of that opinion? If there is ſuch a one, he is very much to be pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied; and how much better are they, that having been at Church, imploy the reſt of the day in paſtime, or drinking? What advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage do they ſeem to have, by having been at Church? for tho they might ſit before God in his place of worſhip as his people do, yet it is evident that their hearts were after ſomething elſe.</p>
            <p>God made the Sabbath for man to reſt on, and not that he ſhould do his own work therein; for theſe perſons can't produce any good authority, for making ſuch a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the ſeveral parts of that day. It is a ſtrange expoſition on the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and it is no wonder that there is ſo many Atheiſts among us, when places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture are ſo expounded, and tho they may ſatisfie their own conſciences in ſo doing, yet the Law looks upon it as a great offence.</p>
            <p>I remember the time when a ſort of men, either out of ill will to their neighbours, or for their own profit, were very induſtrious
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:58538:96"/>to inform againſt ſuch as went to Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, I wiſh they would now be as zealous for Religion and God's honour, in diſcovering thoſe that go to no publick worſhip, or ſpend the remainder of that day improperly; as they then pretended to be zealous for the Church, when they ferrited the Diſſcenters out of their Meetings.</p>
            <p>The next thing you are to inquire of, is the ſin of Drunkenneſs: Thoſe that are common Drunkards, and frequenters of Traverns and Ale-houſes.</p>
            <p>I wiſh they were not ſo many as offend here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and that the abuſes were fewer, that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple receive from thoſe that are Drunk. This alſo is a ſin of Cuſtom, and not of Nature, for Nature requires ſo little, that a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſorder himſelf by taking what is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſatisfie it: So that every Drunkard of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers violence to the bent of Nature, to bring himſelf into that condition: and what is the advantage of it, but to make himſelf nauſeous to others over night, that he may loath him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf next morning, when he is diſgorging the laſt nights entertainment.</p>
            <p>Nothing brings a man ſo near to a beaſt as it does, for it deprives him of the uſe of his reaſon, and expoſes him to more extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies than any other ſin. What difference is there betwixt a drunken Man and a Swine, only, that the Brute has the better of him: for a Swine follows that appetite which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has indued him with, and when he is dead, his carcaſs is worth the meat it has eaten:
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:58538:96"/>But a drunkard forces himſelf beyond his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and when he is dead, is good for nothing.</p>
            <p>I have heard of many that boaſt how they can make others drunk, and how much they can drink: A notable thing indeed, to value themſelves upon, conſidering that a Woe is denounced againſt thoſe that ſet the Bottle to their neighbours Noſe; and he that drinks moſt cannot vaunt of ſo much as an Hogſhead can do.</p>
            <p>Do theſe men think that they were made to only devour the fat of the Land, that they may vomit it up: but their anſwer is, that their Time, Money, and Body are their own, and therefore they may do with them what they will, ſo long as they hurt no body elſe: 'Tis true indeed, they are their own, yet only to ſome intents and purpoſes: For as they may not injure others by the uſe of them, ſo neither can they juſtifie the harming of themſelves; for both Body, Time and Money, are to be imployed for the advantage of others, as well as of themſelves, becauſe every man's Life and Eſtate is more the publick's, than his own.</p>
            <p>In order to the ſuppreſſing of this ſwiniſh practice, you ought to preſent all ſuch Ale-houſes, as of your own knowledge, or by information, ſuffer people to tipple and drink in their houſes at unſeaſonable hours; or that harbour men ſuſpected, and of evil fame, or that ſuffer any other diſorder.</p>
            <pb n="382" facs="tcp:58538:97"/>
            <p>Likewiſe, if there are any Ale-houſes in by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, or other improper places, which through inadvertency or miſ-informatian are Licenced, you ought to preſent them, that they may be ſuppreſſed; for as they do not anſwer the legal end of an Ale-houſe, ſo they are the receptacles and harbours of Thieves and Rogues, and conſequently the occaſion of all the Thefts and Robberies that are committed in the Country.</p>
            <p>There are a ſort of people, who will go Ten or Twelve Miles to a three Penny Doal, that will refuſe ſix pence, if offered them to go four or five Miles, altho they have ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rags to cover their nakedneſs: if you know of any ſuch you ought to preſent them, that they may be ſent to a place, where they'll be forc'd to work.</p>
            <p>There are alſo a ſort of People that ſpend high and live very plentifully, yet have no viſible means of ſupporting that expence: if you know of any ſuch you ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them, that an account may be taken of them and their way of living, which is very neceſſary at this time, when Clipping and Horſe-ſtealing are two ſuch great Trades.</p>
            <p>The laſt thing I will recommend to your Care, is to preſent all ſuch Officers as have neglected their duties in ſeeking and Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending Vagrants and wandering Perſons: I believe Gentlemen, you are very ſenſible that the numbers of theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dle people are great, and that the miſchiefs they bring upon us are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: for they do ſo ſwarm in theſe parts,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:58538:97"/>that it's a wonder if ſome other of them are not apprehended every day, in moſt Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſports: and yet by what the Officers do, one would think there was ſcarce any of them: for in all the time that I have been a Juſtice of the Peace, I don't remember that ſo much as one Vagrant has been ſeized by the Conſtables, unleſs when they have been found pilfering: ſo backward are they to do their duty herein, that one would think the Vagrants were in fee with the Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, or elſe they could not paſs along, as they do without diſturbance; conſidering that the Law has given good incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the apprehending of Vagrants, not only by holding out a reward to ſuch as ſhall apprehend them, but alſo by inflicting a penalty for ſuffering them to paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.</p>
            <p>'Tis ſtrange, that the Petty Conſtables, if not out of regard to their Oaths, yet for the ſake of their Reputations, are not more diligent herein; for he cannot boaſt of much honeſty, who is remiſs in his duty; and it is moſt apparent, that there is a wilfull neglect herein.</p>
            <p>I have now finiſht what I thought fit to diſcourſe on at this time, and ſhall therefore conclude with this ſhort word.</p>

            <head>A Speech againſt Aſſerters of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Power, and the Non-ſwearers.</head>
            <p>I <hi>Believe you are all well affected to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore to incourage you to do your part upon this occaſion, I only need to tell you that this is a time that calls upon the diligence and care of every man that wiſhes well to the publick peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And I am perſwaded that this admonition is not very neceſſary to be given to you, who I believe are already very ſenſible that we are an unſetled and divided people, and in this you will concur with me, that they are very much to blame who are the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Far be it from me, to charge any one fooliſhly, and I wiſh it could not be affirmed with ſo much truth, but it is moſt certain that that Party who in the two late Reigns, were ſo induſtrious to ſerve that intereſt that deſigned to ſet up Popery and Slavery, are the very men that at this time are the troublers of our</hi> Iſrael.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And that you may the better underſtand them and their deſigns, give me leave a little to look back and obſerve to you the principles upon which they ſeemed to Act.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="386" facs="tcp:58538:100"/>
            <p>
               <hi>In the Reign of the two late Kings we had a mighty cry for the Church and Loyalty; but were indeed only diſguiſes for the bringing in of Popery and Slavery, by reaſon that nothing can be more effectual for the bringing in of Popery, than the dividing of Proteſtants; and nothing can make us more arrantly Slaves, than the ſubjugation of us to the Kings will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the rule then laid down was this, that every man that did not come up to every Ceremony of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> tho he profeſſed the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of it, was not to be deemed a good Proteſtant, but to be perſecuted and treated as an Enemy to the Publick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And in the next place, that he only was a Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al man, that did ſincerely believe, that we muſt in all caſes ſubmit to the King's will; and was not in any caſe to be oppoſed, or reſiſted, and tho he never ſo openly violated the known Laws, yet we were only to defend our ſelves with Prayers and Tears.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This notion prevailed with a great many for ſome time, yet it was not the force of reaſon that gave it ſo much reputation, but Rewards and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the one hand, and Frowns and Diſpleaſure of thoſe in power on the other, together with all the other incouragements and advantages that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment could give it; and ſo might any thing, tho never ſo nonſenſical, obtain for a while, when ſo ſupported.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But let it be fairly reaſoned, and it will appear that nothing is more diſtructive to the end of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment than ſuch an unlimited power: Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with all due reſpect to Kings, that they have their frailties and paſſions as well as other men.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="387" facs="tcp:58538:100"/>
            <p>
               <hi>I cannot believe that he who is the moſt indulgent of Arbitrary Power, can be of opinion that God Almighty made mankind to be miſerable; and if ſo, how can that and the abſolute power of Kings be reconciled; for what can render this life more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable than to be ſubject to the paſſions of a man, who is reſtrained by no rules but that of his Will; nor does it ſeem to be conſiſtent with the goodneſs and juſtice of God, to ſubject a people to ſuch a condition; it's moſt plain, that he has not left Kings ſo at large in the exerciſe of their power, and that what power he has given them, was to protect and not to oppreſs his Subjects: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, wherefore do we find ſuch repeated examples of God's diſpleaſure againſt thoſe Kings that have tyrannized it over their Subjects. God is a God of Order, and has ordained that Order and Peace ſhall be the end of every Government; but, is the way to obtain this, by giving ſcope to the unruly paſſions of a man: It's the King's protection that gives him a right to our ſubjection; for when he denys his protection, we may withdraw our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and when the King's protection, or the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects obedience ceaſes, nothing but confuſion can enſue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If God had ordained that every people ſhould be ſubject to the will of their Kings, he would either have expreſly revealed his pleaſure therein, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered it to us by the light of Nature. But no ſuch revealed Will is to be found, and the light of nature tells us that nothing is more unreaſonable than ſuch a power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But put the caſe, that King's are made by Gods immediate direction; yet it is ſcarcely leſs than blaſphemy to conceive, that where he does ſo dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:58538:101"/>his power, that their actions ſhall not have ſuch a temperament of Wiſdom, Mercy, and Juſtice, as in ſome meaſure to reſemble him, whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent: for otherwiſe it would make him the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Confuſion; yet in our late times, all the infringements of the Laws that were made by thoſe two Kings, was called a divine right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And in the next place, he would have provided ſome means, by which the people ſhould have known what would be the Kings Will, for where there is no Law there can be no Tranſgreſſion; for otherwiſe the people would have been in a ſad caſe: For they could not in ſuch a caſe be allowed the uſe of their reaſon; neither could they know when they were in the right, for whilſt they do a thing with never ſo much Reaſon and Juſtice, the King's fancy may make it Criminal; and indeed to govern a people any other way than by known and certain Laws, is to ſuppoſe mankind to be a compamy of Brutes, and not reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It's blaſphemy to ſuppoſe that any of God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are unjuſt, and yet has he given us expreſs rules to be the meaſure of our obedience to him, and can it then be ſuppoſed that he has ſubjected us to the will of our fellow Creature, when he would not require from us ſuch a blind obedience to be paid to himſelf, unleſs we can believe that the ways and commands of a King are more equal and juſt than God's</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If there was a People before there was a King, as no doubt there was, then will it be a difficult un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking to prove that Kings have a juſt right to Arbitrary Power: and I know of nothing that ſavours more of nonſence, than to ſuppoſe a King without a people.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="389" facs="tcp:58538:101"/>
            <p>
               <hi>If the power of Kings is ſo unlimited, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did</hi> Solomon <hi>ſay, that oppreſſion would make a wiſe man made: For where I have a right, it's lawful for me to make uſe of it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore oppreſſion does imply, that what is done is againſt right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſtanding body of our Laws is a clear proof that the power of our Kings is limited: How come we by Municipal Laws, if we muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to their will? for who ever looks into our Conſtitution, will find that it is not built upon an Arbitrary Foundation, but directly calculated to make us a free people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But if it ſhall be anſwer'd me that this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was the work of ſome King, and that he directed the form of our Conſtitution: I do in the firſt place deſire to know who that King was, and in what Age he lived; and in the next place, I ſay, that he was extremely Wiſe and Juſt: and theſe two other conſequences will follow from thence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>That that King did believe that it was not ſo juſt and reaſonable to govern by his Will, as by thoſe rules which the Law has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, that is, that it was more reaſonable that the Law ſhould controul his Will, rather than that his Will ſhould over-rule the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That every King that governs more by his Will, he is ſo much leſs Wiſe and Juſt than that King who was the moulder of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The more effectual preſervation of the publick Peace, is the only pretence that a King of</hi> England <hi>can have for Governing by his Will; but if it be out of that regard, he will find that the Law has
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:58538:102"/>provided ſafer and juſter in that caſe than his Wit can invent, for it's a rule in our Law, that no body is wiſer than the Laws: But too many inſtances have made it plain, that no King ever deſired to rule without the Law, but that he might imploy his power to an ill end: and thoſe then that incourage arbitrary inclinations in their Prince, are guilty of all the Oppreſſion and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that he ſhall commit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Law is the beſt hold both of King and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: for it's their mutual and only intereſt; which ſoever of them lets it go, will have much ado to preſerve themſelves: for never did any ſtand long that parted with it; when the King forſakes the Law, he ceaſes to be King, and makes room for another that is more righteous than himſelf: and therefore, becauſe he endeavoured to ſet his will above the Law, was the late King</hi> James <hi>ſet aſide, and I am perſwaded with all the Juſtice in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus I have indeavoured in a few words to detect the unreaſonableneſs of this arbitrary Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and indeed the great Aſſerters of it at laſt diſcovered what was the true principle that gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them; they had very honeſtly preſcribed a rule for others, which they could not practice them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, like the Phariſees, who were reproved by our Saviour for laying heavy burdens upon others, that they would not touch themſelves. Our Loyal men were very well pleaſed with arbitrary power, whilſt they might be imployed, and lord it over their neighbours; they little dreamt that the wheel might go round; for no ſooner did they ſee that this power was like to be exerciſed upon themſelves, but they changed their note: all their encomiums,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:58538:102"/>upon King</hi> James, <hi>were turned into the moſt bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter invectives that their wit could invent, and their threatnings, which they uſed to breath out againſt the Diſſenters, were turned into words of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and Reconciliation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will not affirm that the mercenary principle of preferment made them ſo zealous for Prerogative, but this is moſt certain, their zeal never abated till they ſaw that other people were like to come into play: and then they were as forward as any to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plode the Doctrine of Non-reſiſtance, and to wiſh ſucceſs to the Prince of</hi> Orange. <hi>But ſince King</hi> William <hi>does not think fit to employ them, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will ſerve their turn but King</hi> James. <hi>And becauſe they cannot for ſhame talk any more of their unſhaken Loyalty, they have wholly laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide that word, and now their mouths are filled with nothing but the Church; and conſidering that they refuſe the Oaths, and indeavour to throw all the contempt they can upon this Government, therefore in their ſenſe the Church and this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment are two diſtinct intereſts; and King</hi> James, <hi>a profeſt bigotted Papiſt, is more likely to ſupport the Church, than King</hi> William <hi>who is a Proteſtant, and thus they demonſtrate their care for the Church: and if it be not becauſe King</hi> Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam <hi>won't put them into imployment, I can't ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine why they ſhould be ſo averſe to him, unleſs it is, becauſe his Government is more Juſt and Mild; and that he Governs more by the Laws than any of the four laſt Kings.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your inclinations to the Government is not to be queſtion'd; yet in regard it has been indeavoured to be ſo much traduced, it may not be improper to ſay ſome thing of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Every King of</hi> England <hi>receiving, and holds his Crown upon condition, to Govern according to the known and approved Laws of Land: for by what means ſoever he may come to the Crown, he can hold it by no other means than by making the Laws the meaſure of his Power: and when he forſakes that good old way, he ceaſes to be King, and Male Adminiſtration is a forfeiture of his Crown. This was the opinion of our forefathers, as appears by the many inſtances of thoſe Kings that have been Depoſed, for their evil Government: And thoſe who have ſucceeded them have ſtill been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and obeyed as rightful, and lawful, tho the other were alive. For when the Throne is vacant, it naturally comes into the hands of the people, becauſe the original diſpoſe and gift of the Crown was from them, therefore whoever they place upon the Throne, has as good a right to be there as the firſt King that wore the Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>No Government can want a power to help it ſelf, and therefore when the King has ſet his will above the Laws, what other means has the people left, but their Arms: for nothing can oppoſe Force but Force. Prayers and Tears are our proper applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to God Almighty, but ſignifie but little with an Arbitrary Prince, who will be rather confirmed
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:58538:103"/>in his purpoſes, when he finds that he is like to meet with no other oppoſition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But this oppoſing the King with Arms is not juſtifiable, for every wrong ſtep, or miſcarriage of the Prince, ſave only in caſes of extremity, when it's obvious to every man, that the King has caſt off his affection to the Common Good, and ſets up his will in the place of the Law, and thereby rendered himſelf unmeet to ſway the Scepter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For this reaſon was King</hi> James <hi>depoſed, and therefore is this preſent Government juſtified to the laſt degree, by very good reaſon, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practice of our Fore-fathers in the like caſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For long before King</hi> Charles <hi>dyed, the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was very apprehenſive of the miſchief they ſhould be exſpoſed to, if in caſe the Duke of</hi> York <hi>ſhould get into the Throne, and he had not long been in poſſeſſion of the Crown before he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced the world, that thoſe jeers and apprehenſions were not groundleſs, for he quickly became ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant in the exerciſe of his power, that the Nation grew very uneaſie under him: where upon the Duke of</hi> Monmouth <hi>landed in order to deliver us from that which the Nation had ſo much cauſe to fear; and it did not pleaſe God to give him ſucceſs. Yet I am perſwaded, it was not by reaſon of the juſtneſs of King</hi> James<hi>'s Cauſe that God permitted him to prevail for ſome years; but that he might fill up the Meaſure of his Iniquities, and all the Earth might ſee how juſtly he was De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To recount the particulars of his Male-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, would take up too much of your time, and therefore I will only ſay this in ſhort; That
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:58538:104"/>he had ſo notoriouſly broken the Conſtitution of this Government, to ſet up Popery and Slavery, that the Nation was neceſſitated to riſe in Arms; and by as good right did they take the Diadem from his Head, as he ever had to claim it: for he having rendered himſelf unmeet to ſway the Scepter, the Crown thereby fell into the hands of the people; and where then could they ſo well and properly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of it, as to ſet it on his Head that ſo generouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and opportunely came in to our aſſiſtance, at a time when the Nation lay gaſping, and juſt ready to expire with the weight of Popery and Arbitrary Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>What horrible unthankfulneſs to God, and ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to King</hi> William, <hi>is every man profeſſing the Proteſtant Religion guilty of, who is diſatisfied with the preſent Government? For I would ask any of them what elſe could have been done, to bring us to a ſettlement, unleſs the recalling of King</hi> James, <hi>or that which would in effect have reſtored him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Does any man believe that King</hi> James <hi>is fitter to govern than he was: Is he a leſs Bigot in his Religion, or better inclined to the good of</hi> England; <hi>nay, may we not rather expect the contrary from him, that he will come in all the rage and fury that the deepeſt revenge can dictate to him, thinking of nothing but Fire and Faggot, to burn up all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And therefore can any man deſire the return of King</hi> James, <hi>but ſuch as have actually made their terms with him, or elſe do hope that he will accept of their ſubmiſſion; but whatever terms they may make for themſelves, they can ſcarcely ſecure it to
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:58538:104"/>their Poſterity; and does he deſerve the name of an</hi> Engliſh man, <hi>or good Chriſtian, that will give up his Poſterity to ſave himſelf; and much leſs can he pretend to it, who will ſacrifice his Country and Religion to the will and pleaſure of his Prince.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>How muſt he diveſt himſelf of all manner of humanity, that implicitly will execute ſuch unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Commands King</hi> James <hi>will lay upon every man that muſt expect any quarter from him, for every man that will not be aiding and aſſiſting to his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, will certainly be treated as an Enemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>There are a ſort of people who may well be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, if not already ingaged, yet very welt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to joyn with any thing that will deſtroy this Government; and they are</hi> Firſt, <hi>ſuch as refuſe the Oaths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Such as have taken the Oaths, but ſwear to this King, as only King</hi> de facto, <hi>and to live peaceably under the Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Give me leave to think that both theſe are much more to blame than the Papiſts, for the Papiſts, purſue their intereſt, whileſt they indeavour to reſtore King</hi> James, <hi>and deſtroy this Government, but theſe other profeſſing themſelves Proteſtants, may be compared to</hi> Solomon's <hi>fooliſh Woman, that pulls down her Houſe with her hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to thoſe who have not taken the Oaths, I ſuppoſe they will not ſay in their own excuſe that they have not, becauſe like the</hi> Quakers <hi>they ſcruple the taking of any Oath, and therefore it muſt be becauſe they don't believe this to be a lawful Government; and if ſo, tho I won't call it a down right oppoſing of it, yet I will preſume
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:58538:105"/>to ſay that the next ſtep beyond this can be no other than directly to fall upon the Government; and I cannot comprehend why they have done this, if they don't intend to go further, if herein they have acted like rational Creatures, that is, to do it for ſome end; and ſince they have thus ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated themſelves from the intereſt of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, they muſt confeſs if, they have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, that this is a very mild Government; and that the King is a very merciful Prince that will afford them his protection, who will not own him, for they will not find in their celebrated Doctrine of the divine right of Kings, and Paſſive-Obedience, that they ought to expect the common protection and priviledge of the Government, when they won't ingage to defend it, and therefore it is not eaſily comprehended, wherefore they do behave themſelves with ſo much aſſurance, and even to glory in what they do, unleſs they expect ſome ſuddaen turn of Affairs; or that they think themſelves ſo very much in the right, and have ſo much vertue and reſolution as to indure the utmoſt extremity that can befall them: but as the firſt is not much to be feared, ſo their inſolent behaviour does not argue that they are altogether acted by a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Conſcience; and I will not condemn all of them, ſince I believe they may make it matter of Conſcience to refuſe the Oaths; but if they would have the world to think ſo, they ſhould behave themſelves ſo quietly and modeſtly as men that are guided purely by their Conſciences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to thoſe that have taken the Oaths, but ſwear to the King, as being only King</hi> de facto.</p>
            <pb n="397" facs="tcp:58538:105"/>
            <p>
               <hi>They ſeem not much honeſter than thoſe that have refuſed the Oaths, and are equally dangerous; for the taking the Oaths in that ſenſe, is a juggling with the Government; for it is to make the King a King and no King, to make him a King for a time, and paying of him a temporary Allegiance; for it is expreſly to declare that ſome body elſe has a better right to the Crown than he, and whenever that other perſon comes in ſight, their Allegiance to this King ceaſes, and their living peaceably under the Government, amounts to no more than that they will live peaceably till they have an opportunity to do otherwiſe, and no longer; ſo that they don't ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to this Government, becauſe they believe it to be a lawful one, but that they may ſerve themſelves of it, and be ſure, which ſide ſoever is uppermoſt, and by this principle they may ſwear to any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, tho never ſo unlawful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the whole matter,</hi> Gentlmen, <hi>you ſee how watchful an eye ought to be kept upon this ſort of men, notwithſtanding they have the Church ſo much in their mouths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> French <hi>had lately a deſign to land upon us, and I believe they ſtill hover about our Coaſts, for ſome ſuch purpoſe, but they will not make ſuch an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, without the expectation of being take by the hand, and who are ſo likely to joyn with them as thoſe who don't allow this to be a lawful Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and it ſo falls out, that thoſe who are now ſecured upon this occaſion, are either ſuch as have not taken the Oaths or elſe have ſworn to this King as King</hi> de facto.</p>
            <pb n="398" facs="tcp:58538:106"/>
            <p>
               <hi>But ſince theſe men talk ſo much of the Church, I would be very glad to be informed how it comes to be in danger, and why they are ſo much the more concerned for it, than the reſt of mankind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I know not well what Church they mean, but the Proteſtant Church of</hi> England <hi>is not ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger'd by any thing as by them, for till its dues and rights are withheld from it, or other violence is offered to it, I cannot imagine why any one ſhould ſay it is in danger. But nothing is ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to the Church, as when men of looſe debauched lives, ſet up for its chief ſupporters, and when the name of the Church is made uſe of as a Stalking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſe to ſerve the deſigns of a ſelf-ſeeking Party: for when this party of men have nothing elſe to urge againſt thoſe things that tend to our ſettlement, they generally cry out it's againſt the Church, ſo that it's hard to know what Church they mean; and this I am ſure of, that I will never be of that Church, that is to be ſupported by King</hi> James <hi>and a French Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In ſhort,</hi> Gentlemen, <hi>if you know of any that have ſpoke contemptuouſly of this Government; have ſaid the King is only King</hi> de facto, <hi>and have ſworn to this Government only to live peaceably un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, or have ſaid that within ſuch a time there will be a change, or any other thing that tends to diſturb the Government, you ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it. If any Parſon or Vicar, not having taken the Oaths, has officiated at his Benefice ſince the</hi> 2d <hi>of</hi> Feb. <hi>laſt, you ought to preſent them: for it is as much an offence, in them to officiate when they have not qualified themſelves, as if they had never been preſented, and their contempt is very great.</hi>

            <pb n="399" facs="tcp:58538:106"/>
            <p>Gentlemen, <hi>Tho I have not mentioned any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of your buſineſs, yet I know you will not neglect them: that which I have ſpoke to, does ſo immediately concern us, that I thought it neceſſary to inlarge upon it. And ſince God has ſo wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully delivered us, we could never anſwer it, if we do not our parts; for if we periſh through our own neglect, our blood lyes at our own doors, and we deſerve the burial of an Aſs, if we dye like Fools: but I truſt we ſhall not, nor do I ſuſpect you will be remiſs in your parts, and therefore I will trouble you no further, but diſmiſs you to your bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and I pray God direct you in it.</hi>

            <head>A Perſuaſive to UNION, UPON King <hi>JAMES</hi>'s Deſign to Invade <hi>England,</hi> in the Year 1692.</head>
            <p>PEace in a Nation, is like Health to a Natural Body, whoſe Value is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently known, but by the want of it. God Almighty is wonderfully gracious to this Land, not only in continuing to us the Bleſſing of Peace, but teaching us the Worth of it, by letting us ſee the Nations round about us at War, and groaning under all the miſerable Effects of it, whileſt it is kept at a diſtance from us, and we are only at ſome Expence; which is unavoidable, all Circumſtances conſidered, unleſs we will ſubmit to that Monſter the <hi>French</hi> King; and indeed God has done ſo many and great things for us, that nothing is wanting to compleat our Happineſs but our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Of all the Mercies this Nation has lately receiv'd, I think our Deliverance from King
<pb facs="tcp:58538:108"/>
               <hi>James</hi> was none of the leaſt, if it be a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to be deliver'd from Popery and Slavery: That we were in great danger of it, I think 'twas very evident, from what we had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, and King <hi>James</hi> had apparently fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſign'd to do, had he been let alone a little longer; for his Government was become ſo exorbitant, that Men of all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions, many of the Papiſts not excepted, did think his Yoak intollerable, and that it was highly juſt to be relieved againſt his Oppreſſion: For when the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> Landed, there was ſcarcely any Man that appear'd for King <hi>James;</hi> nay, a great many of his Army deſerted him; which coldneſs and neglect, could not probably proceed from any thing ſo much as from the ill opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion they had of his Cauſe. Now if any that were then ſo indifferent and paſſive, have now conceived a better opinion of him, it may well be ſuſpected, that a particular pique or ſome ſiniſter byaſs guided their Motion at that time; and if ſo, it's no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what ſide they are on; for thoſe who are govern'd in ſuch Caſes by any thing but a publick principle, are eaſily turn'd about by every breath of Air.</p>
            <p>Nor can I imagine what can give any Man a better opinion of King <hi>James,</hi> than he had of him before he went into <hi>France;</hi> the only place, as he ſays, he could retire to with ſafety, conſidering how improbable it is, that any inſtructions which that Tyrant may give him, will make him
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:58538:108"/>leſs inclined to Popery and Arbitrary Power.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe it is no news to you, that King <hi>James</hi> did lately intend to Land with a <hi>French</hi> Force; I am perſuaded that moſt people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, they that don't may as well doubt whether there was a Gun-powder Plot; for it is as plain as a thing of that nature can be, which has not actually taken effect; and it is as certain, that he and thoſe his good friends had been here ſeveral weeks ſince, had they not been kept back by thoſe Eaſterly Winds which continued ſo long. Yet that did not break their meaſures, it only delay'd the matter; for at laſt they were ready to put all things on Board, but were happily prevented by the wonderful Succeſs of our Fleet; for which the Name of the great God be prais'd.</p>
            <p>The defeating of their deſign is a Mercy never to be forgotten; for no deſign, that we know of, that was ever form'd againſt this Nation, could be more bloody and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive than this would have been.</p>
            <p>For King <hi>James</hi> in his Declaration, does expreſsly ſay, <hi>That his intent is to ſpend the remainder of his Reign, as he has always deſign'd ſince his coming to the Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe words ſpeak a great deal of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to <hi>England;</hi> for they cannot mean leſs, than what he has already done. When he took the Cuſtoms againſt Law; Carried on Sham-plots, by his countenance and bribery, to deſtroy honeſt and worthy Men; When
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:58538:109"/>he bereaved the Corporations of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and Franchiſes; When he turn'd out Judges for acting according to their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and filling the Benches with the Raff of the Gown; When he avowedly ſet up Popery, and erected publick Chapels in all parts of the Kingdom; When he placed notorious Papiſts in the Seat of Juſtice, and brought a Jeſuit into his Councels, which was more than any Popiſh Prince, but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ever did; When he ſet up a High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; When he ſet up in Time of Peace a numerous Army to the Terror of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and allowed ſo little for their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as it amounted to little leſs than Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarter; When he aſſumed a Diſpenſing Power, and declared he would be obey'd without reſerve. Theſe and a great many other Irregularities were the product of his Reign; and it is not very probable that he is brought to a better temper, by any thing that he has ſeen or learnt by his Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the <hi>French</hi> King; and it is as little probable that King would have treated him as he has done, had he diſcover'd in King <hi>James</hi> any diſpoſition to govern more mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and reaſonably for the future.</p>
            <p>How much he is influenced to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is very evident by deſigning to bring in the <hi>French</hi> upon us; the people of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers this Nation ought moſt to dread: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n ſome Hiſtories they are called the Old Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of <hi>England,</hi> and very truly may be called the irreconcilable Enemy of <hi>England:</hi> For
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:58538:109"/>who ever looks into Story, will find that <hi>France</hi> has occaſiond more trouble to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> than all the World beſides; nay, there has ſcarcely been any ill deſign againſt the Nation, but <hi>France</hi> has had a hand in it, as if their very Climate did neceſſitate them to be at Enmity with us: If any of our Kings has deſign'd to enſlave us, they have entred into a Confederacy with <hi>France,</hi> as the People of all others moſt likely to ſerve their purpoſe; and it has always gone ill with <hi>England,</hi> when our Kings have made an intimate friendſhip with the <hi>French</hi> King, as we may remember by woful experience. Let us conſider beſides, that no People in the World are ſo noted for Treachery and Cruelty as the <hi>French,</hi> of which they have given ſuch pregnant inſtances in their new Conqueſts, and the Proteſtants of their own Nation, as were never done by the moſt barbarous and uncivilized People; for after terms agreed on, and a ſubmiſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, and without any new provocation, or other occaſion given on the part of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, the <hi>French</hi> have fallen upon them, taken from them that little that was left, and in cold blood murder'd them, ſparing neither Age or Sex: And ſhall not we then think our ſelves in a comfortable Condition, when we have ſuch Task-maſters as theſe ſet over us? But it ſeems that theſe are they, by which King <hi>James</hi> hopes to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored; by them he will do his work, and they are the Inſtruments he will imploy to
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:58538:110"/>make the ſettlement he deſigns here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> for in his Declaration, he plainly tells us, That if thoſe he brings over with him are not ſufficient, he has more of the ſame ſort ready at hand. Now, though a reconciliation with King <hi>James</hi> were practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, could there be any Moral aſſurance that he would ſacredly keep his Word, and that he had more juſt and righteous Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions than heretofore? Yet to come in ſuch company, and bring ſuch a train along with him, makes it impoſſible to all thoſe who have not abandon'd all Senſe of Religion and Morality, and are not reſolved to run into all the exceſſes of Cruelty and Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and I ſhould think the very thought of it, ſhould be abhorred by every Man, that values himſelf upon the title of a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Man or <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man.</p>
            <p>But that nothing might be wanting to give ſucceſs to this fatal Enterprize, ſeveral perſons in <hi>England,</hi> I believe ſome in every County, were not only privy, but conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, and had prepar'd Horſe and Arms to aſſiſt the <hi>French</hi> at their Landing; yet of what Profeſſion or Communion they are, I forbear to name, and leave that to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd when the Government calls them to account; and therefore only ſay in general, That they who could ſo take the <hi>French</hi> by the hand, may well be ſuppoſed to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the Proteſtant Religion, and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd all bowels to their Country and Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and are reſolved to keep pace with
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:58538:110"/>the <hi>French</hi> in the murders and havock they ſhall commit: for they would render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſuſpected by being never ſo little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs or backward, and thereby turn part of the Invader's fury upon themſelves; for being once ingag'd, there is no looking back, but at the price of being involv'd in the Common deſtruction.</p>
            <p>After all this, what theſe Men will call themſelves, I know not, for they cannot pretend to the Name of Proteſtants and Engliſh-men.</p>
            <p>What they deſerve, that I leave to the Law, which is to Judge them.</p>
            <p>What we are always to expect at their hands, when they have opportunity, I think without breach of Charity I may adventure to ſay, is all the miſchief and ruine that our greateſt Enemies would bring upon us.</p>
            <p>What we are to do, is to bleſs God for bringing the deſign to light, before it took effect, and to do our beſt endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect thoſe who are concern'd in this unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural deſign, that Juſtice may paſs upon them.</p>
            <p>For are not they more to blame than any others that were to have had a hand in this matter? Was it not more unnatural and unreaſonable for them to joyn with the <hi>French,</hi> than for the <hi>French</hi> to have ſuch a deſign againſt us? Would not their joyning in it, have been the chief inducement to bring in the <hi>French</hi> upon us? For ſuch an attempt is altogether impracticable, without hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:58538:111"/>an effectual Correſpondence here, or elſe to ſurprize us, when we are together by the Ears in a Civil War. So that in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, it is they that had brought all the deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation that would have fallen upon their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country, if that deſign had taken ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: He that can be conſenting and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to the rooting up of the Proteſtant Religion, and ruine of his Country, what thing can be ſo bad, as that upon the ſcore of Honour or Conſcience he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe?</p>
            <p>May not a Man, without being thought ſevere, ſay, What profligate wretches are theſe? what accommodation can be made with ſuch perſons? and what ſecurity from them can be hop'd for longer than they want opportunity to hurt us?</p>
            <p>Is it not then the duty of every Man that has any concern for his Religion or Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to do what in him lies to diſcover and bring theſe projectors of our ruine to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice?</p>
            <p>Perhaps you may not receive any clear information, ſuch as will legally convince any perſon of being ingag'd in the deſign I have mention'd: But you may receive ſuch information as will convince any reaſonable Man, that they are concern'd in this or ſome other foul practice againſt the publick Peace.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who have refus'd the Oaths to this King and Queen, cannot be ſuppos'd to be altogether unconcern'd for King <hi>James:</hi>
               <pb n="407" facs="tcp:58538:111"/>But if any ſuch have lately provided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with either Horſes or Arms, is that which ought not to be paſs'd over unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded: it muſt be for ſome purpoſe that they had ſo furniſht themſelves; for people do not uſually put themſelves to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, but when they have a proſpect of making uſe of them: Their refuſing the Oaths is evidence ſufficient that they did not deſign thoſe Horſes or Arms for the ſervice of this Government: then it will naturally follow, that it was againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; for there is no Medium in ſuch preparations betwixt being for or againſt the Government; he that is not for us, may reaſonably be ſuppoſed to be againſt us.</p>
            <p>If any perſons who have not taken the Oaths, and had Arms, yet upon a rumor for ſearch for Arms have either convey'd them away, or before that, had diſpers'd them into hands that are not well affected to this Government, or elſe not duly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lafied to keep ſuch Arms, is that, in my opinion, that carries great ſuſpicion along with it; for what but a ſenſe of their own guilt, could perſuade them to convey away or hide their Arms: or wherefore ſhould they put them into the hands of other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but with a deſign to imploy thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the uſing of them: and then can any Man ſuppoſe, that it was intended for the Service of this Government.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:58538:112"/>
            <p>There is a report of a ſort of people, who for five or ſix Months laſt paſt, have talk'd of King <hi>James</hi> his being here and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in a ſhort time, and of what powerful aſſiance <hi>France</hi> would give him to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: If you, Gentlemen, ſhall be inform'd of any ſuch, it is your duty to take notice of it; for it's plain, by what has been lately diſcover'd, that they did not ſpeak without book: they would not make ſuch diſcourſes for want of ſomething to ſay, but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage people to ingage in it, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the deſign; for Men do not purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make diſcourſes that will render them ſuſpected, and bring them under the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of the Government, but out of a proſpect of ſome advantage.</p>
            <p>I do alſo hear that ſeveral who have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly taken the Oaths to this King and Queen, have ſince lately refus'd them, when upon occaſion they were tendred to them, and others that wiſh they had not taken the Oaths: If, Gentlemen, you ſhall be inform'd of any ſuch, you ought not to paſs it over in ſilence: for by their refuſing the Oaths at ſuch a time, they have juſtly render'd themſelves ſuſpected to be privy at leaſt to the intended Invaſion of the <hi>French:</hi> It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a vain excuſe to pretend they do it out of Conſcience: for if it was lawful to take the Oaths heretofore, how comes it to be leſs lawful now? but if ſome prudential Conſideration, and not Conſcience, prevailed with them at firſt to take the Oaths: there
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:58538:112"/>is then very little reaſon to imagine, that there is more of Conſcience in the refuſing the Oaths at this time, but rather that they are making fair weather againſt ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected revolution; for otherwiſe, why of all others, was this time pickt out to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover an averſion of Swearing to this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment?</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, If any indeavour to leſſen our late Victory at Sea, and to cry up the Naval force of the <hi>French,</hi> theſe do bring themſelves under the ſuſpicion of being no ill-wiſhers to the late deſign of the <hi>French:</hi> For, wherefore ſhould any deſire to make our Succeſs to appear leſs than it is, if he were not ſorry that we had got the better: And wherefore ſhould he extol the <hi>French</hi> Power at Sea, if his good wiſhes did not attend their deſigns, or elſe did thereby hope to keep up the hearts of his Party, that they ſhould not deſpair, but expect ſome favourable opportunity to put their deſign in execution; for they muſt intend either good or bad to us thereby, and which of them is moſt likely, I leave to every Man to judge.</p>
            <p>I have mention'd theſe things, not that I am of opinion that any or all of them put together, without ſome other direct proof, is evidence ſufficient to convict them upon a tryal; for God forbid that any Man ſhould be condemn'd, but upon a fair tryal and clear evidence: But I take notice of thoſe things, as they do render perſons juſtly
<pb facs="tcp:58538:113"/>ſuſpected, to be privy to, or approving of the late deſign againſt this Nation: which as every honeſt Man ought to abhor, ſo it is his duty to keep a watchful eye againſt them; for as the deſign was laid very broad and deep, and the ſucceſs of it is of the greateſt conſequence to them, ſo I am far from believing, that they have given it over for a loſt game.</p>
            <p>And I am the rather confirm'd in this opinion, becauſe of the incouragement they do receive from the unfortunate diviſions that are amongſt us. I wiſh from my Soul we in this City could begin that great Good and neceſſary Work of Union; I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways deſign'd and indeavour'd it ſince you did me the honour to place me on this Seat; and if I have committed any miſtake in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to it, ſhall hold my ſelf oblig'd to him that does ſhew me my error.</p>
            <p>Thinking often with my ſelf of the beſt means to effect this, Two things have ſtill preſented themſelves to me.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That we would for the future ſtudy Charity more, and the Politicks leſs than heretofore we have done; for if Men did ſeriouſly apply their thoughts that way, it would take off moſt of the prejudices they have conceived againſt any upon ſlight and immateral occaſions: or where there is juſter cauſe of reſentment, it will prevent all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary aggravations; it will keep both ſides in better temper, and diſpoſe the one to a more moderate reparation for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:58538:113"/>he has received, and the other to be more ſenſible of his fault, and inclined to make a reaſonable amends; it would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent men from being too apt to take offence upon ſlight occaſions: it will make every man underſtand himſelf better; it will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to him whither his principles are true or erroneous; it will explain to many men their miſtake, who through ignorance did thoſe things whereof afterwards they will be aſhamed.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing is, that every man would conſider, how far his princples and actions have a coherence: For it is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing to be of this or that Principle, but how near he has ſquared his actions to that Principle, that gives any man this title of an honeſt man: For two men of very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent principles may be both very honeſt; if ſo be that they are guided by no other byaſs, but that of their principle: For that is only an error in judgment, which is rather to be pitied than blamed; but to act otherwiſe than according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate of their principle, is in no ſort to be excuſed: for that is it, which truly deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates a man a Knave; he that deſires to be honeſt, muſt take heed that he do not deceive himſelf: for men are apt to value themſelves for being of this or that Party, and to flatter themſelves in what they do, becauſe they profeſs the ſame principle with ſome other perſons, who are of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted honour and reputation. Theſe
<pb facs="tcp:58538:114"/>things are the beſt expedient, that I can yet think on, how far they will go in the matter, every man can judge as well as I; but this I may preſume to ſay, that if people did ſeriouſly reflect upon theſe things they would find ſo much to do at home, that they would have little leiſure to obſerve what people do, or if they ſhould diſcover any thing to be amiſs in their neighbours, their faults would not appear ſo monſtrous and unpardonable as otherwiſe they might.</p>
            <p>Of all the ills of the two laſt Reigns, in my opinion nothing was ſo treacherous and deviliſh, as that of making parties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, that we might become our own deſtroyers; for as it was the ſureſt method to effect our deſtruction; ſo if any thing ſhould interpoſe to prevent our ruin, yet nothing is more difficult than to make up ſuch a breach; and therefore the beſt that could be hoped for from it was to entail up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Nation heart-burnings, and all the ill conſequences of it; I have the charity to hope that many who helpt to carry on that fatal deſign, did it more out of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, than for any ill intention: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the arbitrary Sermons being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered as the Oracles of God, might draw in a great many unwary people; others might comply either out of fear, or elſe out of hopes of preferment: But as new light is ſprung up, ſo I hope and wiſh from my heart, that men would walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly: If any man has been in an error, as
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:58538:114"/>ſoon as he finds it, it's not his ſhame, but duty, as a wiſe and honeſt man, to repent and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake it; and he that being convinc'd of it, ſhall yet perſiſt in it, will find very few to whom his obſtinacy will recommend him.</p>
            <p>If any do think they were in the right, when they ſerved as Bawds to the arbitrary Iuſts of the two late Kings, I heartily pitty them, for their caſe is deſperate; yet I am perſwaded that none of them would of choice had that power exerciſed upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and if ſo they will then grant that what they would not have done to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, is not lawful for them to do or bring upon another: if they ſhall ſtill adhere to what they did, either out of fear, or elſe out of hopes of preferment, they muſt make it appear that this King has reſolved upon the ſame methods that were taken by the two late Kings, or elſe declare that they think that nothing elſe will make him a great and glorious Prince.</p>
            <p>Perehaps ſome men cannot bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to make a publick, or direct recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what they have done, or of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daen to ſeparate from their Party; but yet they may do things ſo by degrees, and ſo fairly too, and without any noiſe, as will teſtifie to the world, that they intend to purſue another courſe.</p>
            <p>As for example; if any who were active in the late Reigns, do now meddle very little (if at all) in publick matters, and modeſtly ſtand aſide, as it were to make
<pb facs="tcp:58538:115"/>room for others who profeſſed that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, which brought about this Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: This will let every man ſee, that they are now of another temper. But if ſuch perſons do ſtill continue to meet and conſult upon publick Affairs, as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the power was in their hands, and do bandy, to ſupport every man of their party at any rate, without conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their abilities, or any objection that may be made againſt them, on the ſcore of their immorality or unjuſt dealings, but implicitly becauſe they are of their party, reſolve to give them the preference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any other: This carries a very ill countenance with it. I cannot imagine what they propoſe to themſelves by ſuch diligence, unleſs they hope for or expect to ſee the like adminiſtration again in <hi>England:</hi> for as it diſcovers no ſort of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to accommodate differences, ſo they cannot but be ſenſible, it will irritate and provoke thoſe of another opinion.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, I think they are very much to blame, who take unneceſſary occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to reproach their neighbours, with what they did in the late times: They that are thus liberal of their tongues, would do well, to conſider, whether they were never guilty of ſome abitrary, or unjuſt action; and whether they have not at ſome time or other done ſomething that has helpt to ſupport ſome of the illegal and unreaſonable proceedings of the late times;
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:58538:115"/>for we are all frail, and had need to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our ſelves before we condemn other people; now if any perſons are guilty in either of theſe particulars, ſilence becomes them much better than reproaching others: however reproaching of men with their faults, is not the proper way to bring them to a right ſence of their errors: whileſt a Sore is rubbed, there's no hopes of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; and men are to be inſtructed by reaſon and not railing.</p>
            <p>Beſides, railing is ſo poor a revenge, or ſatisfaction, ſo that if I could not have a better I would let it alone, for as I ſhould do my ſelf a great prejudice by it, ſo I would not give my enemy that ſatisfaction, who muſt needs be pleaſed to ſee me tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and fret my ſelf: this I am ſure of, that to be ever and anon twiting people with their faults, can breed no good blood, and I wiſh it has not ſome ill effects amongſt us.</p>
            <p>You ſee Gentlemen, I only touch things lightly, and apply them to no body, but leave that to every man as he ſhall find it concerns him; if any thing I have ſaid ſhall do good, I ſhall much rejoyce at it, if not, I hope there's no hurt in menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning ſuch truths as theſe. For I think I may poſſitively affirm, that a Union is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to make us a happy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and that there is not a more certain fore-runner of a peoples deſtruction, than to ſee them divided into Parties and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:58538:116"/>
            <p>I could proceed into a long diſcourſe upon this Subject; but that I may avoid being tedious to you, I will apply my ſelf to the particulars of their inquiry.</p>

            <head>Some Reaſons againſt the Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Diſſenters upon the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Laws.</head>
            <p>I Will offer my Thoughts as to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting of Proteſtant Diſſenters, at this time upon the Penal Laws: But what I deſign to propoſe, is only what ſways with me, and not to impoſe upon any Man, but to leave every one to approve or diſlike it, according to the reaſons I ſhall give.</p>
            <p>To proſecute them who agree with us in the ſame Doctrines, as it is not practiced in any other part of the World, no, not by the Papiſts themſelves, ſo I fear it will look like a playing of their game for them: For it is confeſſed by the Jeſuits, that they have found it the moſt infallible way to bring in Popery into any place by ſomenting the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions amongſt Proteſtants: And if a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration be ever neceſſary, without queſtion it is at this time expedient, and the Houſe of Commons were of this opinion when they paſſed this Vote <hi>Jan.</hi> 10. 1680/1. That is the opinion of this Houſe, That the Proſecution of Proteſtant Diſſenters upon the Penal Laws is at this time grievous to the Subject;
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:58538:119"/>a weakning the Proteſtant Intereſt, an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to Popery, and dangerous to the Peace of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Now how far this ought to be regarded, I leave to every Man to conſider; but to my own particular, there ſeems to be great reaſon and prudence in it, conſidering our preſent circumſtances.</p>
            <p>If it ſhall ſo fall, out ſince the making of the Act of the 22d. of this King againſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious Conventicles, that the Diſſenters have not at their Meetings preach'd any Doctrine, but what tends to inſtruct and perſuade Men to do their duty to their God, their King and their Country, then we ought to remember his Majeſties Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from <hi>Breda,</hi> April 14. 1660. which I find in print in theſe words:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We do declare a Liberty to tender Conſciences, and that no Man ſhall be diſquieted, or called in queſtion for differences of Opinion in matters of Religion, which do not diſturb the Peace of the Kingdom; and that we ſhall be ready to conſent to ſuch an Act of Parliament, as upon mature deliberation ſhall be offered to us for the full granting that Indulgence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though we are unhappy by reaſon of the want of a Law for the uniting of all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, yet I conceive that this Declaration of his Majeſty's is a very plain admonition to us, to uſe a tenderneſs towards thoſe who preach ſound Doctrine, and live peaceably with us; and for my part, I have not heard of any to be accuſed for Preaching unſound
<pb facs="tcp:58538:120"/>Doctrine or Sedition; if there be any ſuch, ſpare them not; but let the utmoſt ſeverity of the Law paſs upon them, and let them ſuffer for evil-doing: But if there is no proof againſt them for preaching Sedition or Rebellion, it's hard to puniſh Men upon a Suppoſition, who worſhip God in a way that may be acceptable to him: And though I can and do conform to what the Church enjoyns, yet I have ſo much charity as to believe that the Proteſtant Diſſenters are in a direct way to Heaven, though they do not uſe the Ceremonies commanded by the Church, provided that they worſhip God in fear, with a good Conſcience, and live according to the Rule of his Word: If they love Mercy, do juſtly, and walk humbly with God: But if a Man, profeſſing himſelf to be of this or that Church, ſhall believe that he may take greater liberty, becauſe of his profeſſion, I fear it will not much avail him at the laſt day: It's the Heart that God regards; he requires Mercy rather than Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</p>
            <p>The Proteſtants in <hi>France</hi> are at this time under great Perſecution; and if we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to proſecute the Proteſtant Diſſenters here, what incouragement can they have to come over hither in hopes of bettering their condition, ſince they will be under the ſame circumſtances with our Diſſenters; and if not here, where can they hope to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved? And thus their condition is made deſperate.</p>
            <pb n="413" facs="tcp:58538:120"/>
            <p>The proſecution of Diſſenters at this time muſt be for one of theſe Reaſons, as I apprehend: Out of regard to our Oath, or under pretence of ſerving the Church to aſſiſt Popery; or elſe, becauſe we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that they cut off the late King's head: If it be out of regard to the Oath, then it muſt be remembred, that there lies the ſame obligation upon us to all other Laws that are within our Charge; but we are more eſpecially bound to execute thoſe Laws which immediately reſpect the glory of God, and the common Good; and there are ſeveral Laws, which if duly executed, would tend more to the glory of God, than proſecuting of Diſſenters: As common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs and open Debauchery, and the great abuſe of Sunday, and prophaning of God's Worſhip by coming drunk to Church; and when the Service is over, return again to their tippling, and ſpend the reſt of the day at that work, and yet think they do very well; they think they can go to their Houſes juſtified, becauſe they can roar and ſwear they love the King and the Church, and wiſh the confuſion of all people who do not with them run to the ſame exceſs: Whereas they are not to be truſted by the one, and are a reproach to the other. And the knowledge of theſe things might eaſily be come at, if we made it as much our bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to inquire after theſe things, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the Informers thereof as much as we do the Informers againſt the Diſſenters.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:58538:121"/>
            <p>The ſecond Reaſon of proſecuting Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, is, Under pretence of ſerving the Church, to aſſiſt Popery; but this is ſo abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable a piece of Hypocriſie, that, I hope, no Man, who profeſſes himſelf a Proteſtant, will ever be guilty of it.</p>
            <p>The third and laſt Reaſon is, Becauſe we are perſuaded that it was the Diſſenters who cut off the late King's head: But that can be no inducement, becauſe, firſt, there is no ſuch publick Judgment paſſed, for it is not declared who did it; and there are more who believe it was the Papiſts, than that believe it was the Diſſenters; and it's moſt probable the Papiſts did it, by reaſon of the great joy at <hi>Rome</hi> upon the News; and the Papiſts here in <hi>England</hi> ſaid publickly, That now their greateſt Enemy was dead, when their King was beheaded: And beſides, there is a very good argument, that the Diſſenters hand did not give that ſtroak, in regard they were chiefly inſtrumental in his Majeſties Reſtauration, whileſt many who called themſelves the Loyal Party ſate ſtill at home: Or if it were, as ſome ſay, that the Diſſenters did that fact, yet we cannot juſtifie the proſecuting of them for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe it would be a breach upon the Act of Oblivion, a Law that was and is ſo neceſſary to ſettle the diſtractions of the Nation; and he who would deſtroy that which compos'd our differences, does what in him lies to bring in confuſion.</p>
            <pb n="414" facs="tcp:58538:121"/>
            <p>There are ſeveral Laws which are not Temporary, nor are they repealed by any other Statutes, and yet are laid aſide as uſeleſs, becauſe the Reaſon of them is cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and Laws ceaſe when the Reaſon of them ceaſes, as our Lawyers ſay: And if ſo, I cannot tell, whether it is not a very good argument, why the Diſſenters ſhould not be proſecuted upon the 22d. of this King, ſeeing they cannot be charged to have preach'd unſound Doctrine, nor to be guilty of any contrivance againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>I wiſh the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſtood upon a broader foundation, and the proſecution of Diſſenters would increaſe the Number of Souls; but truly I have not heard that it has had that bleſſed effect; nay, I doubt it has wrought the contrary way: For the reaſon of it is plain, becauſe the Engliſh people are very inclinable to pity any that are in diſtreſs, nay, though they are puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed juſtly, but when they ſee any in trouble on the account of ſome ſmall difference in Religion, they not only pity them, but, after a while, do favour their caſe: And if the Laws had been put vigorouſly in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the Papiſts before the diſcovery of the Plot, they would have found a great number who would have pitied them, though the very name of Popery is deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the generality of the Nation.</p>
            <p>As no Man knows his own heart certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by reaſon of the deceitfulneſs of it, ſo
<pb facs="tcp:58538:122"/>it is impoſſible for one Man to know ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers thoughts; and if any Man that proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes the Diſſenters does it for theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that I have mentioned, or for any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I hope he has a good end in it, and acts according to his Conſcience, and then I wiſh him good ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>If I were a buſie Man, in proſecuting of people for Non-conformity, I'll tell you in what method I would proceed; but by this I don't pretend to preſcribe any Man what he ſhould do; if I can govern my ſelf a-right it's as much as I deſire, I don't take my ſelf to be very able to inſtruct others.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place I would begin with the Papiſts, becauſe they differ with us in Doctrines; and therefore we and they can never agree, unleſs one ſide yield wholly to the other: I would inquire after the times and places of their Meetings, and watch them ſo narrowly, that they ſhould hardly eſcape me; and I would make it my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to find out their Prieſts, that the Law might paſs upon them; and this I would the rather do, becauſe I am perſuaded that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Papiſts would live peaceably with us, if there were an effectual Law to keep out the Prieſts; and theſe Incendiaries, I would leave them no reſt for the Souls of their feet, but I would hunt them out of the Country: For by reaſon of not putting the Laws in execution againſt the Prieſts, that bloody Maſſacre happeded in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in which there periſhed at leaſt 200000 Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:58538:122"/>Now when I had perfectly ſubdued the Papiſts, that they might do us no hurt, then I might be at leiſure to fall upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who did not conform to the Church: And if upon the Informations it did appear, that they preached unſound Doctrine or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, I would not fail to rout their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but upon every information I would examine whether what was preached was unſound or ſeditious, becauſe the 22d. of this King was made chiefly to prevent Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and as to all other Laws, I would not be wanting in my duty to ſerve the Church: Only as to the 35th. of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ſome doubt would remain with me: Firſt, Becauſe the Papiſts are not within that Law, and it is more ſevere than any Law now in force againſt the Papiſts. Secondly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I cannot find that any Man has been puniſh'd by that Law; if any have, the preſidents are very few, and that Law was made upon a ſuppoſition of evil practices at their Meetings, as was that of the 22d. of this King; and I am verily perſuaded that the reaſon, why few or none have been pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd by that Law is, becauſe they have not been detected of any Sedition or Practice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Government: But if I did put that Law in execution, I would do it againſt one as well as another, though they made a great ſtir for the Church, it ſhould not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, nay, with me that ſhould be an aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their offence; and I doubt, that there are a great many who pretend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb facs="tcp:58538:123"/>very zealous for the Church, and cannot with patience bear with others, who cannot go ſo high as they do, and yet are notorious Offenders againſt this Law of the 35th. of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now by this method I apprehend I ſhould incur the leſſer cenſure, and that the World would be more apt to believe that it was my concern for the Church, that made me ſo zealous, provided my Life and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation were agreeable to that of a good Chriſtian, or otherwiſe I ſhould have much ado to perſuade the World that my End was good, unleſs I led a good life: For whenever any have profeſſed themſelves Zealous for their Church, and their Lives have not been anſwerable to their Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the end it has proved that their Zeal was but a pretended one, to facilitate and carry on ſome ſelfiſh or ill deſign; and of this there are multitudes of inſtances, and not one to the contrary that I have met with; and the reaſon of it is obvious to every Man; for why ſhould he have a real Conſerve for the Church, who by his Life diſhonours God: Neither do I believe that I ſhould convince the World that I was zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for the Church, if I fell upon the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, and did not firſt begin with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts: For to think that the Papiſts can be good Subjects as Papiſts, and that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters are equally dangerous with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, proceeds from the ſame Principle, which is a falſe one.</p>
            <pb n="416" facs="tcp:58538:123"/>
            <p>Having ſaid this, I will, in the next place, offer my advice to the Diſſenters; That in regard there are ſuch Laws which ſtand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repealed, and that many are of opinion that they ought to be put in execution, without examining whether any Sedition or Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion is hatch'd at thoſe Meetings, and that thoſe Meetings may be lookt upon as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning of the Government, and may give offence; I think they would do very well at this time to forbear their Meetings, at leaſt to be ſo moderate in their Numbers, that it may appear, they do not glory in their Multitudes; and by this Moderation I hope they may induce others to have a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter opinion of them; and inſtead of taking them to be Men who practice againſt the Government, they may be found to be Men of Peace and of a good Conſcience, and to be ready to ſtand by the Government a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Papiſts and all other Enemies; and then the Government, in due time, may be prevailed upon to paſs a Law for the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Proteſtants.</p>

            <head>A DSICOURSE Proving the Reaſonableneſs OF THE Preſent REVOLUTION, From the Nature of Government.</head>
            <p>THat our <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Civil Rights</hi> were upon the Brink of <hi>Deſtruction,</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve none doubts, or is Diſpleaſed at our <hi>Deliverance,</hi> except thoſe who were Inſtrumental in bringing on our intended ruine, or do wiſh for an Opportunity to finiſh it. Ever ſince the <hi>Reformation</hi> the united <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> of the whole <hi>Popiſh Interest</hi> has been at work to reduce this Nation to the <hi>Romiſh Yoak:</hi> And firſt they attempted to do it by force, but after many Trials they found that Method was ineffectual, and that nothing could ruine <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> but it ſelf, and therefore all their Wits were imploy'd how they might ſet us at odds amongſt our Selves, that we might become
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:58538:125"/>our own Executioner: And at laſt they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried their Deſign very far, for it is not long ſince that we ſaw a ſort of Men amongſt us, who were guilty of as much Folly as <hi>Solomon's fooliſh Woman,</hi> that <hi>pulls down her Houſe with her Hands,</hi> and had ſo much ignorance or Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as to pretend that all they did was for the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> and tho' what they did was never ſo much againſt Law, or void of Morality, yet they termed every man <hi>diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected</hi> who did not cry <hi>Amen</hi> to all their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; and even moſt of the <hi>Clergy</hi> (who might have been ſuppoſed to have had either more knowledge or Integrity) Preach't up and juſtifyed in their <hi>Pulpits,</hi> all the <hi>Irregularities that were then practiced,</hi> with as much aſſurance and Zeal as if they had delivered the <hi>Oracles of God:</hi> Whereas it was obvious to all Men of common Senſe, that the Conſequence of theſe things muſt be to bring in <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery,</hi> for it was laid down as undoubted Doctrine, <hi>That the King had a Natural Right to the Crown,</hi> and <hi>That the King was not to be oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in any caſe;</hi> the ſum of all which is, <hi>That the King may commit all manner of Oppreſſions, and we are bound to ſubmit to it for Conſcience ſake;</hi> which if ſound Doctrine, would make God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty unjuſt, and the Author of Confuſion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what he has declared of himſelf in <hi>Holy Writ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps not rightly underſtanding the true Nature of Government might occaſion thoſe Miſtakes, and I have that Charity for a great many, that I do believe they were led out of the way for want of true Information in the
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:58538:125"/>Point, and therefore, for the rectifying of their Judgments, and confirming of yours, I will with your leave, give my Thoughts in this Matter, by which you will be the better able to Judge of the unreaſonableneſs of thoſe things that have been impoſed upon us in point of our Duty to the Government.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Government</hi> in general, and that there ought to be ſome ſort of <hi>Government,</hi> I take to be not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary, but of Divine Right; but the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular form is a Humane Ordinance, and the <hi>Apostle</hi> is my Authority, who has in expreſs terms declared it to be ſuch: For all Forms are equal in themſelves, and that becomes preferable to the reſt, which beſt ſuits the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of the People, in order to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the <hi>Common Good:</hi> For had God liked any Model or Shape above the reſt, all the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments under the <hi>Sun</hi> would have been of the ſame Form; for in a thing of that abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity he would not have left the World in the dark, but either have expreſly revealed it, or diſcovered it to us by the light of Nature: But we don't find in <hi>Holy Writ</hi> any ſuch Intimation of his Pleaſure, nor has Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture yet inabled us to find it out; For there never was, nor is not is at this day, any two Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments of the ſame ſhape, but differ in ſome thing that is very Material and eſſential: And if God had thought any one Form of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> to be better than the reſt, he would not have permitted that of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar People, to have been altered; but we find that the Model and Form of their Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution was altered and changed no leſs than
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:58538:126"/>five times: So that it is plain that God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty left every People (the <hi>Jews</hi> excepted) to frame ſuch a conſtitution, as well as to the meaſure of Power of thoſe with whom they intruſted the Adminiſtration, as of the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the <hi>Subjects,</hi> whereby the <hi>publick Peace</hi> might be beſt preſerved, and that the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and juſt extent of the <hi>Prerogative</hi> cannot be ſuppoſed to go further, than what men in their wits, and without conſtraint would judge was neceſſary to relieve the Subjects againſt the extremity of the Law in ſuch Caſes as could not be foreſeen at the time the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was agreed on, and becauſe in the two late Kings Reigns, the <hi>Prerogative</hi> was advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to an unreaſonable height, the better to accompliſh the Work of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery;</hi> I think I ſhall not miſpend your time if I offer a few Words further upon this Point. There is not any thing in our Law-Books to juſtify the ſtretching of the <hi>Prerogative</hi> ſo far, but it is pretended that <hi>Authority</hi> is found for it in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and if ſo, the <hi>Word of God</hi> will juſtify that Oppreſſion and Violence, that our known Laws will not Countenance; and then it will follow, that the Law of God is not ſo juſt and equal as the <hi>Statutes</hi> and Ordinances of Men: And without queſtion it muſt be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry extraordinary, that the <hi>Bible</hi> ſhould tell us any thing of our <hi>Government,</hi> that is not to be found in our <hi>Statutes</hi> or <hi>Law Books.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am perſwaded that the Holy Scripture was never more wreſted to ſerve a turn than of late it has been to maintain the <hi>Divine Right</hi>
               <pb n="425" facs="tcp:58538:126"/>and abſolute <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> for which theſe Texts are chiefly inſiſted on:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By me Kings Reign: Where the word of a King is, there is Power, and who may ſay unto him what doeſt thou? Let every Soul be ſubject unto the higher Powers, for there is no Power but of God: The Powers that be are Ordained of God. Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever therefore reſiſteth the Power, reſiſteth the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God: And they that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves damnation: Wherefore ye must needs be ſubject not only for Wrath, but alſo for Conſcience ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe and ſuch like Texts of Scripture are to be taken in a limited Sence, or elſe theſe two abſurdities will follow, Firſt, <hi>That God Almighty made the world for the ſatisfaction of the luſt and pleaſures of the Kings that are in the Earth, and not for his own Glory,</hi> whereby he would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Author of all the Oppreſſion and Violence that they ſhall commit. <hi>Secondly, If theſe Texts are not taken in a limited Sence, they cannot be reconciled with other Places in Scripture,</hi> and thereby God Almighty would contradict himſelf, both of which are no leſs than Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy to conceive of him: And when theſe are compared with other Texts that do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain them, they will be found to be Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove that the <hi>Power of Kings is limited by Law,</hi> and the Right which they claim in the Crown is from the <hi>Conſtitution of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and not by Gods immediate appointment. For as to that Expreſſion, <hi>By me Kings Reign;</hi> he that looks into the Story, will find that theſe Words are not a Declaration of the <hi>Right or Power of Kings,</hi> but are enumerated
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:58538:127"/>amongſt the many and great things that are done by Wiſdom, all which would be too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to mention at this time; or if they were declaratory of the <hi>Kingly Power,</hi> yet they are far from leaving Kings at large in the exerciſe of that Power; for the Words that follow in the ſome Verſe, <hi>and Princes decree Juſtice,</hi> do plainly Argue, <hi>That Kings Reign no longer by God than they decree Juſtice,</hi> not when they Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern by their Will, without the Guidance of the Law. So that by this it is clear, that <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Gouernours</hi> are reſtrained within cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain bounds and limits of Juſtice, and Right, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the eſtabliſht Government.</p>
            <p>The next thing to which I will give an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, is theſe Words; <hi>Where the word of a King is, there is power, and who may ſay unto him what doeſt thou?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every Command of the King, ſo far as it is warranted by the Law, is not to be diſputed, but to be obeyed for Conſcience ſake: And it is the Intereſt of every man to enforce an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to it, becauſe it is for the <hi>Common Good.</hi> But that a Man muſt be bound to obey any Commands, whereby no advantage accrues to him or the Publick, and is really to the detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of both, I no more underſtand, than that a man ought to be his own Executioner in any Caſe. And if the <hi>Commands of the King</hi> are to be obeyed without diſputing the Legality of them; then it will follow, That all his Commands are equally Juſt, or elſe, that his <hi>Fiat</hi> makes that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uſt and lawful, which was not ſo in it ſelf, and then by parity of reaſon his Command ſhall make that unlawful
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:58538:127"/>which was juſt and reaſonable in it ſelf; and at this rate, no man can tell whether he act with or againſt the Law, till the King has declared his pleaſure: Now whether this does not rather confound and deſtroy the very End of Government, than ſupport it, I leave to every man of common Sence to Judge, and I think tho more might, yet it need not be ſaid to make it clear, that this Text of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is far from proving, <hi>That Kings of Right have an unlimited and abſolute power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let every Soul be ſubject to the higher Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I take the meaning of theſe Words to be this; <hi>That Government in general, is of Divine Inſtitution and that when any People, and thoſe that they ſet over them, have entred into a mutual Stipulation of Protection and Obedience under ſuch Rules of Policy and Juſtice, as are not inconſiſtent with the Word of God; this constitution is hereby ſo far ordained by God, that it must be ſubmitted to, not only for Worth, but alſo for Conſcience ſake, ſo long as thoſe in Authority do Govern according to the Preſcripts of the Constitution:</hi> And thoſe words muſt be underſtood in this or ſome ſuch like Sence, for if they are taken Literally, then it will follow, <hi>That God preſcribed the Model of every Government;</hi> but no ſuch Direction is to be found in <hi>Holy VVrit</hi> concerning any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, except that of his peculiar People, the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> and beſides, every Government un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sun would have been of the ſame ſhape if God had directed the Model of them; but they cannot be taken literally, becauſe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. ſays, <hi>Submit your ſelf to every Ordinance of
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:58538:128"/>man for the Lords ſake; whether it be to the King as Supreme, or unto Governors' as unto them that are ſent by him for the puniſhment of Evil doers, and for the praiſe of them that do well:</hi> And from theſe Words I take it to be clear, that it was left to every People to form ſuch a Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Government as beſt ſuited their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations; But if God had more expreſly delivered him as to the form of Government, yet that of <hi>Romans</hi> 13. <hi>Let every Soul</hi>—is no warrant for the abſolute Power of Kings, for the 3d. and 4th. Verſes in that Chapter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains it within bounds, where it ſays, <hi>For Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers are not a Terrour to good works, but to the evil.</hi> Wilt thou then not be afraid of the Power? do that which is good, and thou ſhalt have praiſe of the ſame; for he is the <hi>Miniſter of God</hi> to thee for good, but if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the Sword in vain, for he is the Miniſter of God, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger to execute Wrath upon him that <hi>doeth evil.</hi> Theſe Words are as expreſly reſtrictive of the <hi>Kingly power,</hi> as Words can be in any caſe; where he is to Protect or Puniſh is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively directed, and not left to his diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to call it Good or Evil, according to his power or fancy, but the Execution of his Power is to be guided by the <hi>Rules of Gods word, and of the Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If God had preſcribed one or more <hi>Models of Government</hi> for the World, yet he would not have allowed that to be lawful in Kings which he has ſo often and ſeverely reproved and puniſht; and under great Penalties he has reſtrained their Adminiſtration within the
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:58538:128"/>bounds of Juſtice and Judgment, and becauſe therein he has only delivered his pleaſure in general, therefore Kings are to ſubmit to ſuch Explanation of what is Juſt and right, as the Conſtitution of the Government has declared: For if this Explanation reſted in the Breaſt of Kings, the <hi>Condition of Subjects</hi> would be worſe than that of Brutes, unleſs Kings were endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Wiſdom and Purity of an Angel of Light. If Brutes be ſo chaſed and hunted that they are forced to leave their Native Soil, yet wherever they can find reſt for the Soal of their Foot, they will meet with Food and Lodging, and all other Neceſſaries. But when by reaſon of Oppreſſion and Bondage men are neceſſitated to quit their Habitations and Country, muſt inevitably periſh unleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by the Charity of others. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore plain that an abſolute Power in any King muſt be gained either by force or fraud, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God has not conferred any ſuch Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and it cannot be ſuppoſed that men in their Wits, and without conſtraint, would put into anothers hand a power that may hurt them, when it depended upon their pleaſure whether he ſhould have it or not; for a power in a King to <hi>Oppreſs and Burden his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> is inconſiſtent with the true Nature and deſign of Prerogative, which was given to the Crown to relieve the Subject, where the Law was too keen, the better to further the publick Peace.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Prerogative</hi> be ſet above the <hi>Law,</hi> it will quickly devour it, for there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt making the King <hi>Abſolute,</hi> and
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:58538:129"/>deſtroying the Law, becauſe then all our Laws and Statutes are only Rules during his pleaſure, and a King that deſires to ſit at eaſe will not find his reckoning in it, for if the Prerogative be once raiſed above the Law, he thereby quits his beſt Title to the Crown and leaves the deciſion of the Right to the Sword, and then he that has the ſharpeſt will prove by that Rule, to have the beſt Right, but he that has a better Title will not claim under the Sword.</p>
            <p>What has been ſaid, may in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure expoſe that vile and ridiculous Doctrine of <hi>Paſſive Obedience and Nonreſiſtance,</hi> which the Example of <hi>David</hi> ſufficiently refutes, and no man can pretend to Juſtify, but either becauſe he wants common Sence, or in hopes of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, will (if he can) outface all manner of Truth. However it was ſo uſeful to carry on the Deſign of <hi>Popery</hi> and Slavery, that all poſſible ways was tryed to propagate this Doctrine, and all Diſcouragements put upon thoſe who did any thing to leſſen the credit of it: Juſt like <hi>the policy of the Romiſh Prieſts, who forbid the Laity the uſe of any Books that may give them better Light;</hi> and it is very ſtrange that this Doctrine did not obtain more Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, conſidering how it was ſupported both by the <hi>Palpit</hi> and <hi>Preſs.</hi> But God be praiſed that the Nation preſerved its underſtanding, and that the time is come that the Truth may be ſpoke in publick.</p>
            <p>And I would have ſtopt, but that I conceive it to be convenient to ſay ſomething to let you ſee how ſenceleſs and impudent they are who
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:58538:129"/>profeſs themſelves to be Proteſtants, and yet are diſſatisfyed that the late <hi>K. James</hi> is ſet aſide and King <hi>William</hi> placed upon the Throne.</p>
            <p>And firſt I do ſay, that I thought it my Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to draw my Sword in the Defence of my Religion and Government, and I did and do think it as lawful to reject the late K. <hi>James,</hi> as to place K. <hi>William</hi> on the Throne: And I hope to ſatisfy all that hear me, that the preſent Settlement is Juſtifyed both by the Laws of God, of Nature and the ancient Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>If what is done were rather expedient then lawful, yet one would think that particular perſons might acquieſce in what is done by the collective Wiſdom of the Nation, I mean the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> and I ſhall ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that man to be miſtaken, who thinks himſelf either more wiſe or Juſt than the two <hi>Houſes of Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Till the <hi>Prince of Orange</hi> Landed, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that moſt were of Opinion, that we had but this Choice left us, <hi>either to Turn or Burn,</hi> and I am inclinable to think that all ſuch as are for recalling K. <hi>James,</hi> are prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to turn, and I wiſh every man that has a mind to have him here again were with him; I know not whether it would be beſt for them, but I am ſure it would be ſo for every man that wiſhes well to <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to ſpeak more home and directly: I take it, That there was a People before there was a King; That they ſet the King over them for their good; That the Obligation
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:58538:130"/>of <hi>Protection</hi> and <hi>Subjection</hi> is Mutual: That a King by reaſon of his <hi>Male Adminiſtration</hi> may forfeit his Crown; That the End of Government is <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Order;</hi> That it is more for Gods glory for every man to ſit ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under his Vine than to be oppreſſed? That no Government can be deſtitute of a Power to relieve it ſelf; That the whole is better than a part; That this late Settlement is no new thing, the like having been done in all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Governments.</p>
            <p>To ſuppoſe there was a King before there was a People, is as ridiculous as to ſuppoſe a man to be born before he is begot; or that a man can live without Food, or run before he can go, and it will follow that a King may be a King of nothing, for what is a King if he have no people? Multitudes of other Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities will follow, ſo that I need not ſay any thing more to it.</p>
            <p>And I think the next thing is as plain, that it is for their good when a People ſets a King over them; For to what other intent can it be done; all things are done for ſome end, and a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cannot be ſuppoſed to be void of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of <hi>ſelf preſervation,</hi> ſince that is inherent in Brutes and Plants, and nothing that either breaths or grows but endeavours to preſerve it ſelf and can it then be imagined that a People would chooſe a King for their hurt rather than for their good? Indeed ſometimes in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to a People, God has blinded their Eyes in their choice they have made, but their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>And I take it to be as clear, that the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Protection and Subjection is Mutual;
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:58538:130"/>for the very Nature of all Agreements proves it; for in any thing of that nature, if one ſide be bound and the other at Liberty, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates the folly or Raſhneſs of the one Party, and cunning or good Fortune of the other, and cannot ſo properly be called a Bargain as a Submiſſion. Subjection is really an Effect of Protection, and ariſes from it; otherwiſe <hi>Parents</hi> would have it in their choice to provide for or neglect their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and tho' their Right is from Nature, and for that Reaſon more Arbitrary than when it proceeds from compact, yet no man will deny, but that <hi>Parents</hi> are bound to Educate and provide all other Neceſſaries for their Children, as far as their Subſtance will enable them, and that nothing can diſcharge them of this Obligation but the Notorious Diſobedience and wickedneſs of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: The Nature of our <hi>Allegiance</hi> proves that the <hi>Obligation</hi> is mutual, becauſe the King takes the <hi>Coronation Oath,</hi> before the Subjects ſwear to him, which ſhews that our <hi>Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> is Conditional, and ſuch it is in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular <hi>Governments,</hi> for what can induce one man to obey another, but that he ingages to protect him; for if I am bound to obey where I have not an Aſſurance of Protection, then if a <hi>Tyger</hi> or other Monſter could get into the <hi>Throne,</hi> I ſhould then be under the ſame Obligation of Obedience, but the reaſon of this is ſo obvious to every one of common Sence, that I will ſay no more to it.</p>
            <p>I think it will not be diſputed, that the End of <hi>Government</hi> is <hi>Peace and Order,</hi> if not
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:58538:131"/>for theſe, it muſt be for <hi>Confuſion,</hi> becauſe there is no Medium between <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Confuſion;</hi> now God could not intend the latter, becauſe he has declared himſelf to be a God of <hi>Order,</hi> and therefore ſince all <hi>Government</hi> in general does Originally proceed from God, that Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration is rather an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation</hi> than <hi>Government</hi> that commands or permits the Diſturbance of the Subjects in the Enjoyment or Poſſeſſion of their Rights and Properties. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will follow, That it is more for Gods glory, that every man do ſit ſafe and quiet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his <hi>Vine</hi> and <hi>Fig-Tree,</hi> than to be oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> intimates a <hi>wrong</hi> or <hi>Injuſtice,</hi> and God will not Authorize that which he has declared to be unjuſt; <hi>for juſt and righteous are all his ways: Oppreſſion will make a wiſe man mad,</hi> which ſhews that Subjects have a right in their <hi>Properties,</hi> as well as Kings have to their Crowns: If there were not ſome ſuch Right, there could be no Oppreſſion or Injuſtice, for Oppreſſion or Injuſtice, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>IT has been declared in the Affirmative by ſome modern Precedents; But whethen thoſe Judgements did Proceed from Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Laws, or to ſerve a Turn will be enquired into when the time comes, that the <hi>plain Engliſh</hi> may be ſpoke, that is neceſſary to open and diſcover the truth of the <hi>Caſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are ſeveral things which may give occaſion to make it be ſo generally received in the Affirmative, but it has chiefly proceeded from making Diſtinctions where the Law has not diſtinguiſhed, which is altogether forbid, if Rules in Law are of any Authority, or ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify any thing, for <hi>non eſt diſtinguendum ubi Lex non diſtinguit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore this Opinion will eaſily be refuted by conſidering theſe things which follow.</p>
            <pb n="438" facs="tcp:58538:134"/>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Whether any Court, the Parliament ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, can Try a man upon an Indictment for High Treaſon, that is grounded upon Common Law?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>To what end and intent the</hi> Statute 25. Ed 3 Chap. 2. <hi>was enacted?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Whether Couſpiring the Death of the King, and Levying of War are diſtinct Species of Treaſon?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Whether every Law is not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued moſt ſtrictly to reſtrain the miſchief againſt which it was enacted?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>What is the true meaning and ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being provably attainted by</hi> Overt Deed?</p>
            <p>As to the firſt, it ſeems to be out of doubt, that at this day, there is no ſuch thing as an <hi>Indictment at Common Law</hi> for <hi>High Treaſon,</hi> tho for other things there is, becauſe there is no Precedent of it ſince the <hi>Statute</hi> 25. Edw. 3. for every Priſoner that is Arraigned for <hi>Treaſon,</hi> does commonly demand of the Court, upon what Statute he is Indicted, and it is always anſwered, upon ſuch a Statute, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Statute is named; Beſides, every <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment</hi> before the <hi>Lords</hi> in <hi>Parliament</hi> is grounded upon ſome <hi>Statute,</hi> and if ſo, a <hi>Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ori:</hi> no inferiour Court can try the Priſoner upon an <hi>Indictment</hi> for <hi>High Treaſon,</hi> grounded upon <hi>Common Law:</hi> For the Law which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in Certainty, eſpecially in Caſe of Life, will not allow of an Indictment at <hi>Common Law,</hi> becauſe no Iſſue can be joyned upon it by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the uncertainty.</p>
            <p>As to the Second, <hi>To what end and intent the Statute</hi> 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>was made. Edw.</hi> 3. was a great
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:58538:134"/>Prince and Victorious Captain, which gained him a very great Renown, but that which made his Name the greater, and his Fame the more laſting, was thoſe good and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Laws which were enacted in his time, by which he reſtored and beautifyed this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which had been defaced, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt deſtroyed by the illegal Proceedings during his Fathers irregular Reign and of all the Oppreſſions, under which the Nation groaned at that time, there was none that lay heavier upon them than that extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Licenſe which the <hi>Judges</hi> took to Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret, and call any thing <hi>Treaſon:</hi> and this appears by the particular Joy which the whole Land expreſſed at the making of the aforeſaid Statute. For tho' he call'd <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> very frequently, and none of them prov'd abortive, for every one of them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced good Laws, yet that <hi>Parliament</hi> which was held in his 25th Year, did more than all the reſt, and of all the Beneficial Laws which were then enacted, the Second Statute, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Treaſon</hi> was reduced to a certainty, gave the People greateſt cauſe to lift up their Hearts and Voice in Thankfulneſs to <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>King,</hi> becauſe the Jaws of that devouring Beaſt were broken, which had torn in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſo many Families, and threatned deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the reſt. So that this Statute was made to reſtrain all Treaſons, that may be made by inference or implication, and to limit the <hi>Judges</hi> ſo ſtrictly, that they may not call any thing <hi>Treaſon,</hi> but what is literally ſuch with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

               <pb n="440" facs="tcp:58538:137"/>in the Statute; for it is there provided, <hi>That if any ſuch like Treaſons ſhall come before any of the Juſtices, that they muſt ſlay, without going to Judgement, till the Cauſe be declared before the King and his Parliament.</hi> And all ſubſequent <hi>Statutes of Treaſm,</hi> are as ſo many Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this Law, for they had been need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the <hi>judges</hi> could have called any thing Treaſon, but what is literally within that Statute; and that Statute had been made to no purpoſe, if it had not ſo ſtrictly reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Judges.</hi> And my Lord <hi>Chancellor No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham</hi> was of Opinion, That even the Lords in <hi>Parliament</hi> could not proceed upon an Indictment of <hi>High Treaſon,</hi> unleſs the Fact alledged in it were firſt declared by ſome Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute to be Treaſon.</p>
            <p>As to the third thing. It never was, not ever will be denyed, that Compaſſing the Death of the King, and Levying of War, are two diſtinct Species of Treaſon, unleſs all Treaſons are of the ſame kind, but if there are ſeveral ſorts of Treaſons, then it will follow, that theſe are alſo diſtinct. Becauſe in every Statute of Treaſon which mentions <hi>Conſpiring the Death of the King, and Levying of War,</hi> they are named diſtinctly; beſides, they are different in the manner of Proof, for that which is neceſſary to prove the one, does in no ſort prove the other; and furthermore, the one may be effected, and the other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much as intended or deſigned; as that the King may be Murdered and no War levyed, nor intended: And moreover in the
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:58538:137"/>one Caſe, it is Treaſon as well to intend, as to execute it, without relation to, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joyned with any thing elſe; but it is not ſo in the other; for it is <hi>Treaſon</hi> abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely in it ſelf, as well to compaſs the Kings Death, as to Kill him; But an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to Levy War, and the doing of all things in order to it, is not Treaſon, unleſs the War be levyed, except by Miſplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Inference; and thus much may ſerve to prove that they are diſtinct Species of Treaſon.</p>
            <p>As to the Fourth, No doubt, that every Statute is to be conſtrued moſt ſtrictly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the Miſchief againſt which it was enacted: For the Uninterrupted courſe of all Judgments and Reſolutions, have been accordingly, and nothing can more directly thwart common Sence, than to make it otherwiſe; and therefore if the State be abſolute, the more forcibly that it is conſtrued to reſtrain the Miſchief, the more truly is the intent of the Statute pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued; for how ſhall any evil be ſuppreſt if the remedy muſt be applyed but by halves: For the Law would then be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Mockery than a means to redreſs the Miſchief, if it ſhall not be taken moſt ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt it; either it is, or it is not a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of the Evil; if it is not, why was it made; If it is, It muſt be underſtood in that Sence, by which the Miſchief or Evil, may be effectually prevented and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
            <pb n="442" facs="tcp:58538:138"/>
            <p>As to the Fifth, The Anſwer will be beſt underſtood, by Conſidering firſt the Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of theſe two words apart, Viz. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vably,</hi> and <hi>Overt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Provably,</hi> Signifies <hi>To prove or make good,</hi> by Evidence, Argument, Reaſon or Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Overt,</hi> has all theſe Significations, <hi>open, clear, plain, apparent, manifeſt, notorious, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, known, undoubted, certain, perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This then being the Significations of thoſe Words; what then can follow more Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, than that to be provably attainted by <hi>Over Deed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> is that the Fact muſt not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be direct, apparent, and notorious to the point, but it muſt alſo be proved clearly, evidently, plainly, and perſpicuouſly void of all doubt or obſcurity; and thoſe two Words being taken together, do the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Expound each other, and ſeem to be choice Words culled out by the penners of that Statute, as the moſt expreſſive againſt all Implications and Inferences, which might be made in Caſe of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being premiſed, which are as eaſily proved as alledged, there will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main very little for them to maintain their Opinion, who ſay, <hi>That a Conſpiracy to Levy War, is an Overt Act of compaſſing the Death of the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The things which are commonly and
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:58538:138"/>chiefly urged for that Opinion, are theſe two.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It would be of dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, if a Conſpiracy to Levy War, may not be interpreted an <hi>Overt Act of Compaſſing the King's Death,</hi> becauſe there is no means left to prevent it, and the Miſchiefs atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it, when the War is Levyed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> If a War be levyed, the Death of the King muſt needs be intended, and will certainly enſue if the Rebels prevail.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to theſe it may be replyed, That the one of them is but a bare Objection, and that the other is no ſubſtantial Argument, becauſe it begs the Queſtion, and then ſurely that muſt be a feeble Opinion, that has no better a Foundation.</p>
            <p>But a more particular anſwer to them, will diſcover the Sandy Foundation upon which this Opinion is built: And it will be more proper to begin with the Second, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in giving an anſwer to that, the other will in a great meaſure receive an Anſwer alſo.</p>
            <p>Therefore as to the <hi>Second,</hi> It may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that the Death of the King is made ſo certain and neceſſary a Conſequence of Levying of War, that by reaſon of that certainty, a Conſpiracy to Levy War, is an <hi>Over Act</hi> of Compaſſing the Kings Death: Now therefore, if that certainty will not hold, but that many Caſes may be put, and Inſtances produced, wherein the Kings Death is not intended, nor did it enſue
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:58538:139"/>upon the prevailing of the Party; then is the whole weight and ſtrength of that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of <hi>None Effect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Hugonots</hi> in <hi>France</hi> have heretofore Aſſembled together in Arms, and tho' they repeated it ſeveral times, yet in which of thoſe Occaſions does appear, either by the cauſe of their coming together in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or by the iſſue of it, that it was Levelled at the <hi>Kings Life;</hi> No, the Cauſe of their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in Arms, was for the aſſerting of their Religion and juſt Rights; for as ſoon as their Reaſonable Demands were ſatisfyed, they laid down their Arms more willingly than they took them up; neither did they attempt any thing againſt the Kings Life, when he was in their power; but after they were anſwered in thoſe things to which they had Right, both by the Laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Government, immediately they returned home in peace, and upon all other occaſions proved the moſt firm and Loval Subjects of all that Kings Dominions, and as this preſent <hi>King of France</hi> muſt wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for them, if he will do them Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>France</hi> ſhould at this time take up Arms upon ſo juſt a provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as they now have, it would be very ſenceleſs to ſuppoſe that they Levy'd the War with a principal Deſign to Murder the King, and not for the Defence of themſelves and their Rights, which are ſo inhumanly, and againſt all Law and Juſtice at the
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:58538:139"/>ſame time invaded and raviſht from them. Story is full of like Caſes and Inſtances to this: but to ſpeak more particularly to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> What was the <hi>Barons Wars,</hi> the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to which muſt be, that they took up Arms to aſſert their Rights and Liberties, which the King, contrary to his Oath, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held from them, and that it laſted near 40 Years, yet the Kings Death was never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, nor his Life in any danger, for as ſoon as their juſt demands were anſwered, they put up their Swords, and every man returned home, and pray'd for the life of the King. And out of <hi>Engliſh Story</hi> what one inſtance can be produced, where the cauſe of <hi>War</hi> was declared to be againſt the Kings life, or if that party prevailed, the King was put to death by their general conſent and approbation: For tho' it be true that there are ſome inſtances where they have been Murdered after the War, yet it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo as true, that it was by private Aſſacina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not by the conſent and privity of thoſe who levyed the War, for all thoſe that were concerned in the Murder, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and executed for it as Traitors, as in the Caſe of <hi>Edw.</hi> 2d and <hi>Richard</hi> 2d. And as for that of <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, which is ſo much preſſed and urged, tho' the Cauſe of War had been expreſly againſt his Life, yet as one Swallow does not make a Summer, ſo neither does one Precedent prove the Point; but beſides in that caſe of <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, to infer from thence, that the
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:58538:140"/>Kings Death is principally intended by le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying of War, is altogether as weak an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, as to ſay, becauſe a thing falls out by accident, therefore that very thing was the principal Deſign and Aim of the whole Action: For in that War, thoſe who firſt took up Arms, did it to oppoſe the Kings Arbitrary Practices, and tho' he was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards put to Death, yet it was altogether againſt their intent or deſire, and moſt of the Army was againſt it, and would have prevented it, but that they were at that time ſo broken into Factions and Parties that they durſt not truſt one another; for after the Tragedy was acted, thoſe who firſt took up Arms, immediately upon it laid them down, and were afterwards the chief Inſtruments in the <hi>Kings Reſtoration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if the Kings Death is the principal thing deſigned by levying of War, To what purpoſe is the War levyed? cannot the King more caſily be taken off by poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or a Private Aſſacination, to the effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which opportunities cannot be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and ſo with more certainty they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their End, and run leſs hazard in the executing of it, than they would by a War, except they are not content to Murder him, unleſs they cut the Throats of all thoſe that would defend him: Indeed to do it by an open War, rather than Poyſon, or a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Aſſacination is the more generous way; for they give him warning and timely No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:58538:140"/>to look to himſelf, like a generous Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that ſcorns to kill his Adverſary baſely. 'Tis indeed to go round about for the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt way. Therefore, a War when levyed muſt be for ſome other intent then to take away the Kings life, ſince when <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> enjoy their Rights, no Prince is ſo great and happy in the Heads, Hearts, Hands and Purſes of his Subjects than an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh King</hi> is.</p>
            <p>But yet allowing that upon every War levyed, the Death of the King would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly enſue if the <hi>Rebels</hi> prevail, yet this Queſtion does not naturally ariſe, Viz. <hi>Where is that Statute which does in expreſs Terms ſay, that a Conſpiracy to levy War is Treaſon;</hi> For if it be not ſo expreſly and lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally within ſome Statute, then it is a <hi>Conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Treaſon,</hi> and conſequently no ſuch Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as upon which the Judges may proceed, if the Statute 25th <hi>Edward</hi> 3d. was made to any purpoſe, for that Statute reſtrains all <hi>Constructive Treaſons</hi> or none, but if the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges may in any one Caſe make a <hi>Conſtructive Treaſon,</hi> they may do it in all, and ſo we are left in the ſame uncertainty about <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> as we were before the Statute 25th <hi>Edw.</hi> 3 was made.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Judges</hi> might Judge upon <hi>Conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Treaſon,</hi> yet it ſeems to be a far fetcht Conſtruction, to make a <hi>Conſpiracy to levy War, an Overt Act of compaſſing the Kings death;</hi> for this is not to be provably attainted by <hi>Overt Deed.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="448" facs="tcp:58538:141"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe that <hi>Conſpiring the Death of the King,</hi> and levying of War, are two diſtinct Species of <hi>Treaſon,</hi> and therefore it would be very unnatural, and too much forc't to joyn theſe two together, and as it were to unite them, that are ſo different and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, not only in the manner and Matter of Proof, but alſo in themſelves.</p>
            <p>For then, <hi>Secondly,</hi> a Conſpiracy to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any other <hi>Treaſon,</hi> may alſo be called an <hi>Overt Act of imagining the Kings death,</hi> which was never yet pretended.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A Conſpiring of any one <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> may be an <hi>Overt Act</hi> of any other <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Any other Criminal Act, may as well be called an <hi>Overt Act of Conſpiring the Kings Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> This is to make it a Treaſon of it ſelf, for there is very little difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt calling a thing Treaſon in it ſelf, and to make it an <hi>Overt Act</hi> of ſome Treaſon within the Statute.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> A <hi>Conſpiracy to levy War,</hi> was not <hi>Treaſon</hi> at Common Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> The Statutes of the 23d of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the firſt and 3d <hi>Jac.</hi> 4th which make it <hi>High Treaſon,</hi> to Reconcile any to the <hi>Church or See of Rome,</hi> or to be ſo recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, were enacted to no purpoſe, if a Conſpiracy to levy War, is an <hi>Overt Act of compaſſing the Kings Death;</hi> for what can tend more plainly and directly to levy War, than to perſwade the People to renounce
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:58538:141"/>their <hi>Allegiance to the King,</hi> and to promiſe <hi>Faith and Obedience</hi> to ſome other Power; ſo that theſe and all other Statutes concerning Treaſon, which have been made ſince the Statute 25th <hi>Edw.</hi> 3d. are as ſo many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations of it, and prove that the <hi>Judges</hi> can call nothing <hi>Treaſon,</hi> but what is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally ſuch, within that or ſome other Statute.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> My <hi>Lord Cook</hi> ſays, <hi>That a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy to Levy War is not Treaſon, unleſs the War be levyed in facto,</hi> and queſtionleſs his Opinion is very good Law, becauſe in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Caſes, it is not Treaſon to levy War, and a <hi>Fortiory,</hi> a <hi>Conſpiracy</hi> cannot; for look into the Statute Firſt of <hi>Queen Mary</hi> 12th, where it ſays,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If any Perſons, to the Number of twelve on above, being aſſembled together, ſhall intend, go about, practice or put in ure, with Force and Arms unlawfully, and of their own Authority, to change any Laws made for Religion, by Authority of Parliament, ſtanding in force, or any other Laws or Statutes of this Realm, or any of them the ſame number of twelve or above, being commanded or required by the Sheriff of the Shire, or by any Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of Peace of the ſame Shire, or by any Mayor, Sheriff, Justices of the Peace, or Bayliffs of any City, Borough or Town Corporate, where any ſuch Aſſemblies ſhall be unlawfully had or made, by Proclamation in the Queens Name to retire, and repair to their Houſes, Habitations or places from whence they came; and they, or any of them, notwithſtanding ſuch Proclamation, ſhall
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:58538:142"/>continue together by the ſpace of one whole Hour, after ſuch Commandment or Requeſt made by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, or after that ſhall willingly, in forcible and Riotous manner attempt to do or put in ure any of the things above ſpecified, that then, as well eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuch abode together, as every ſuch Act or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, ſhall be adjudged Felony. And if any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or perſons unlawfully, and without Authority, by ringing of any Bell or Bells, ſounding of any Trumpet, Drum, Horn or other inſtrument, or by Firing of any Beacon, or by malicious Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of any Words, or making any Outcry, or by ſetting up, or caſting of any Bill or Writing, or by any other Deed or Act, ſhall raiſe, or cauſe to be raiſed, any perſons to the number of twelve or above, to the intent, that the ſame perſons ſhall do or put in ure any of the Acts above mentioned; and that the perſons ſo raiſed and aſſembled, after Commandment given in form aforeſaid, ſhall make their Abode together, in form as is aforeſaid; or in forcible manner put in ure any of the Acts aboveſaid: That then all and ſingular Perſons, by whoſe ſpeaking, deed, act, or other the means above ſpecified, to the number of twelve ſo raiſed, ſhall be adjudged Felons. If any Perſons to the number of forty or above, ſhall Aſſemble toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by forcible manner, unlawfully and of their own authority, to the intent to put in ure any of the things above ſpecified, or to do other Felonies or Rebellions, act or acts, and ſo ſhall continue together by the ſpace of three Hours after Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation ſhall be made, at or nigh the place where they ſhall be ſo aſſembled, or in ſome Market
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:58538:142"/>Town thereunto next ajoyning, and after Notice thereof to them given, then every perſon ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly aſſembled in forcible manner, and ſo continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together by the ſpace of three Hours, ſhall be adjudged a Felon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The things provided againſt by this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute are plainly and directly a levying of War, yet are they declared to be but <hi>Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi> But it may be objected, that by Statute 3d. and 4th <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. Thoſe Offences were made Treaſon, it is very true, yet it does not alter the Caſe, but rather proves the Point; For firſt, it being made Treaſon by Statute, proves that it was not ſo in it ſelf. Secondly, Becauſe in the two next ſucceeding Reigns it is declared to be but <hi>Felony,</hi> for the Statute of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Statute 1ſt. <hi>Eliz.</hi> 16. and therefore the Argument is the ſtronger, becauſe thoſe two Queens were of different Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions. Thirdly, Becauſe when a thing is declared an Offence by Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and is afterwards made a leſs Offence, it proves, that it was not ſo great an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in it ſelf, but that the neceſſary Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Time and Affairs, require it ſhould then be ſuch.</p>
            <p>But the Caſe is yet ſtronger, becauſe, in ſome Caſes it may be but a Treſpaſs to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy War, as it was in the Caſe of the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> 5th <hi>Henry</hi> 4. He did actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally raiſe Forces, and ſuch as was taken to be a levying of War, for which he was
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:58538:143"/>queſtioned before the Lords, and tryed for <hi>High Treaſon,</hi> but tho' the Lords did believe the Fact, yet they adjudged it but a Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, becauſe the Power raiſed were not againſt the King, but ſome Sabjects. This precedent ſeems to carry great weight in it, firſt, becauſe it is a Judgment given in the higheſt Court of Judicature, and Secondly, Becauſe it was given ſo ſoon after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Statute. 25th <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt be ſuppoſed to underſtand the meaning of the Statute full as well as ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Ages.</p>
            <p>The Caſe of thoſe who aided Sir <hi>John Oldcaſtle,</hi> might be alſo urged if there were occaſion, but what has been already ſaid is ſufficient, yet one Clauſe in that Statute 25 <hi>Edward</hi> 3d. is not to be paſſed over in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, becauſe it puts the matter out of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and the Clauſe is as follows;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If percaſe any man of this Realm ride Arm'd, covertly or ſecretly, with Men or Arms againſt any other, to Slay him, or Rob him, or take him, or retain him till he hath made Fine or Ranſom for to have his Deliverance, it is not the mind of the King nor his Council, that in ſuch caſe it ſhall be adjudged Treaſon, but it ſhall be judged Felony or Treſpaſs, according to the old Laws of the Land of old times uſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This proves, That altho' the Statute had made it Treaſon, yet that it was not ſo in it ſelf, and therefore it will follow, that if a War may be levy'd, which is neither
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:58538:143"/>Treaſon nor Felony, ſo it is unnatural that a Conſpiracy to Levy War ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued to be an <hi>Overt Act of Compaſſing the Kings Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Second thing Objected has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a full anſwer, and likewiſe the firſt in a great meaſure, but to put all out of doubt, a few words ſhall be added to give a compleat anſwer to the firſt alſo.</p>
            <p>If the Conſequences on all hands be duely conſidered, the danger will be found to lye on the other hand, yet be it as great as it can be pretended, let it be conſidered, that the Law has ſettled the point, and ſo it muſt ſtand, till by the ſame Authority it be alter'd, for the Rule in Law, is not to be forgot, <hi>Nemo Legibus Sapientior.</hi> It is to be pretended, that out of a tender regard, that the Law, and all Subjects ought to have for the Kings Life, that a Conſpiracy to Levy War, is taken to be an <hi>Overt of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing the Kings Death.</hi> To this it may be anſwered, by way of queſtion; How comes it about, that this Age ſhould have a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter care and tenderneſs of the Kings Life, than our Porefathers had? Can it be Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that they did not underſtand the Nature of the Government as well as we do, nor did know of what Conſequence to the Publick, the Preſervation of the Kings Life is? Can it be thought that they did not duely weigh and conſider the conſequence on all hands? Yet however were there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo many Defects in it, ſeeing it is ſettled by Law, it cannot be altered but by the
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:58538:144"/>ſame Power, for if it may, then let the Conſequence be duly conſidered of leaving it in the Breaſt of the Judges to rectify the Miſtakes or Deſects, be they Fictions or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, for then, when a turn is, to be ſerved the Law ſhall always be defective, and ſo in effect they ſhall <hi>Legem dare;</hi> Treaſon will then be reduced to a certainty, that is, if the Judges pleaſe, otherwiſe not. There will be no need of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> for the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſhall both declare and make Law. What will all our Laws ſignify, tho made and penned with all the Wiſdom and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration that a <hi>Parliament</hi> is capable of; if the <hi>Judges</hi> are not to be tyed up and guided by thoſe Laws, it renders <hi>Parliaments</hi> uſeleſs; and ſets the Judges above a <hi>Parliament.</hi> They can undo what the other has done; the <hi>Parliament</hi> Chains up ſome unruly Evil or Miſchief, and the <hi>Judges</hi> let it looſe again. But beſides, where is this dangerous Conſequence as is objected? Indeed there had been ſome weight in the Objection, had a <hi>Conſpiracy to levy War</hi> been left wholly unpuniſhable, but the Law has provided a puniſhment commenſurate to the Offence, and tho' it does not extend to Life, yet is ſufficient to deterr Men from the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it; yet if a <hi>Conſpiracy to levy War is to be puniſht in a high degree,</hi> as a <hi>War</hi> when levyed, this would be to puniſh Thoughts as highly as Deeds, which if it be juſt, yet it is <hi>Summum jus.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="455" facs="tcp:58538:144"/>
            <p>VVhere the Law has provided a Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for an Offence, the <hi>Judge</hi> can paſs no other Judgment upon the Priſoner, no no more than the Executioner can execute the condemned Perſon, in any other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than according to the Sentence paſſed upon him, without incurring the Guilt of Felony; for the one is but the Officer to declare or promote the Law, and the other the Miniſter to Execute it.</p>
            <p>Therefore, upon what has been ſaid, this concluſion will follow, that no man can (before the Judges) be Convicted of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, unleſs the Fact be expreſly and literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Treaſon within ſome Statutes, and he be thereof provably attainted by ſome <hi>Overt Deed,</hi> and conſequently a <hi>Conſpiracy to levy War</hi> is not an <hi>Overt Act of Compaſſing the Kings Death.</hi>

            <head>REASONS For an UNION Between the CHURCH And the <hi>Diſſenters.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WE have at this day many things to lament and complain of: and there is nothing that is a greater cauſe of General Sorrow than the Rents and Diviſions that are amongſt <hi>Protestants:</hi> It is confeſſed on all hands, that the only way to repair theſe Breaches is, that both ſides muſt yield; but who muſt lead the way, is the firſt queſtion, and to that I think there is a very Natural Anſwer, which is this. That they who have the Care and Guidance of the Church,
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:58538:146"/>ſhould by their Condeſcention in ſome things that are <hi>indifferent,</hi> give a good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to induce Diſſenters to come up to be more conformable; for they that are the Guides are to lead and not to follow: As if there be a New Law made whether they that are to ſee it duely executed, ſhall firſt put it in practice, or elſe neglect it till it be done by the Rabble; and in this I conceive there is no difficulty, neither can there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny doubt in the other. And there is yet a further Reaſon of it; for what hopes have <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters</hi> to affect an Union, by coming up to ſome things, ſo long as they ſee the Biſhops are ſo far from parting with One Indifferent Ceremony, that they are dayly re-aſſuming ſeveral things that the firſt Reformers had caſt away: ſo that they are at nocertainty; for what know they but when they have conformed to all that is now <hi>injoyned,</hi> then ſhall other <hi>new things</hi> be impoſed upon them? So that without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, it is neceſſary that the Biſhops do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the work; and methinks they ſhould ſtrive to have the <hi>Honour of ſo Famous an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,</hi> as to be the <hi>firſt Authors of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitiug Protellants:</hi> and it is to their <hi>Reproach</hi> that they have delayed it ſo long.</p>
            <p>It is true there is an <hi>Objection</hi> made againſt remitting any Ceremonies, which is this; <hi>That Diſſenters are not yet reſolved what they would be contented with; and therefore if you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with them ſo far as they deſire, all things would be brought into confuſion, and the Church
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:58538:146"/>would be laid deſolate and therefore the Ceremonies are to be kept to preſerve Order and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity in the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do acknowledge that <hi>Order and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> are very neceſſary to be maintained; but ſurely that is not the right way to preſerve Order and Unity in the Church, by making things neceſſary that are indifferent (if that be the worſt that can be ſaid of them) to keep Thouſands out of the Church; and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks that man ventures very far, who will make that neceſſary for which he has no Command from our Saviour, or the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. I do alſo acknowledge, that there is no great hopes to bring in all Diſſenters; but though I cannot gain all, yet ſhall we not bring in as many as we can? and he that has conſidered it without prejudice, cannot but be of Opinion, That if Three or Four things were taken away, or left <hi>ad libitum,</hi> that ſeveral thouſands would conform, and be very good Sons of the Church. And theſe things which they deſire not to have impoſed on them, are not <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> and if they were taken away, would leave the Doctrine of the Church as ſound as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> perhaps more pure, becauſe it would come <hi>nearer to the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Iaſtitution;</hi> which perhaps is that that makes the <hi>Morſel</hi> ſo bitter to their <hi>Lordſhips</hi> the <hi>Biſhops.</hi> But beſides this, theſe ceremonies which <hi>diſſenters</hi> find fault with, are old <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Ceremonies,</hi> and retain'd by the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers to bring in the <hi>Papiſts</hi> that were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to turn; and beſides it had been as <hi>dangerous</hi> to have taken away all at a clap,
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:58538:147"/>for <hi>Q. E.</hi> had ſeen the bad effects of a ſuddain thorough change both in the time of her father, and her ſiſter <hi>Q. M.</hi> and therefore ſhe would not pretend to build <hi>Rome</hi> of a day, nor to take it down the next, but ſhe <hi>proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> by <hi>degrees</hi> as ſhe found the people would bear it: For its a <hi>dangerous</hi> thing to preſs any thing againſt the ſtream of the Nation, and who e're he be that thinks to carry it, will find himſelf <hi>Groſly Miſtaken:</hi> Therefore ſhe was forc't to keep in Many of the <hi>Popiſh Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,</hi> the better to unite the People; and if that was her deſign in retaining theſe <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi> then without queſtion we have no further occaſion for them, becauſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is at an end for which they were retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And no man can be ſo ſenſeleſs as to think that the firſt reformers had done all that was to be done, but that they left ſome thing for them that ſucceeded to finiſh: They had Marked out the work, and have done a great deal towards perfecting of it, but yet they left a great deal to do for them that came after: And I wiſh it were alſo conſidered, that in regard the firſt reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers retain'd theſe <hi>Ceremonies</hi> to bring <hi>Papiſts</hi> into the Church; why ſhould not we have the ſame Charity to lay them aſide, and bring in <hi>Proteſtant diſſenters?</hi> Ought not we to have the ſame bowels of Compaſſion that they had? As for my own particular, I can comply with every thing that the Church does Command, but it cannot but trouble any good man to ſee his brethren ſhut out
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:58538:147"/>of the Church, becauſe he has not on ſuch a ſuit of Cloaths, or will not bow to this or that Poſt: The Kneeling at the Sacrament; I wiſh there be not too much Idolatry in it, and bowing to the Altar is of the ſame peice: but I believe there are <hi>Thouſands</hi> who have never conſidered theſe things ſo far, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not at all; who are very averſe and do not conform, becauſe they Savour of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery; for the temper of <hi>England</hi> is bent againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> the name of it is diſtaſtful to thoſe that know not what it is: Therefore it is plain that it is not for the good of the Church that theſe Ceremonies are not layed aſide, and the Biſhops themſelves do know that the Churches would be fuller if theſe <hi>Ceremonies</hi> were left indifferent: But the true reaſon why they contend ſo ſtrongly for <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> it is not to preſerve the Church, but to ſupport themſelves; for they very well apprehend, that their ſloath and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of their Cures, would be layed open by the care and vigilancy of many <hi>Pious and able men,</hi> who would conform, if <hi>Ceremonies</hi> were left <hi>indifferent:</hi> And then it would not be ſo eaſy for them to ingroſs ſuch <hi>Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes</hi> of Livings and Church-preferments into one hand: They are afraid left peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples eyes ſhould be further <hi>inlightened,</hi> and a thorough reformation ſhould be wrought; it is terrible to them to think of reducing <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> to its primitive inſtitution: They are <hi>ſenſible</hi> that then it will be diſcovered that in the <hi>Primitive</hi> times there was no ſuch
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:58538:148"/>thing as an <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> and that it came in with <hi>ſuperſtition and blindneſs:</hi> Theſe and abundance of other things that I could reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſtick on their <hi>Stomacks,</hi> but I will not looſe your time by recounting of them.</p>
            <p>In regard therefore that the enjoying of <hi>Ceremonies</hi> keeps <hi>Thouſands</hi> from conforming: I deſire to be anſwered, whether they who ſtickle for <hi>Ceremonies</hi> do not play that <hi>Popes Game</hi> to his greateſt <hi>advantage,</hi> for that which the <hi>Pope</hi> has always made his deſign, is to divide <hi>Protestants,</hi> and he knows there is no other way to ruine them but by fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting differences amongſt them; for all his other devices have proved nothing in <hi>Compariſon</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>And yet theſe <hi>Ceremony-Mongers</hi> do ſpeak plain ſometimes; for tho they pretend to be for uniting of <hi>Protestants,</hi> yet they will tell you that <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are worſe than the Devil, and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are to be eſteemed of ten fold better then they ſo that it will out ſlip them ſome times; do they not openly own their deſign, and when e're they mention the Plot; How plainly do they bewray themſelves? with what difficulty are they brought to <hi>acknowledge</hi> the belief of it? But no ſooner was that faction of the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Plot</hi> ſtarted, but preſently they ran away with it as the greateſt truth, every where arguing people into the belief of it: As if themſelves had had a hand in it, or elſe were ſuch well wiſhers to it, that they deſired it might ſucceed: For it is not to be
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:58538:148"/>denyed that no people have been leſs active, if not altogether paſſive againſt the <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> than theſe <hi>Ceremony-Idolaters,</hi> and the <hi>Biſhops</hi> themſelves: So that with <hi>Submiſſion</hi> I take it to be plain that <hi>Popery</hi> is at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom; And whileſt that prevailes, there is little hopes of uniting <hi>Proteſtants</hi> by our dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyed <hi>Clergy;</hi> and therefore the <hi>Parliament</hi> muſt do it, if 'ere it be done.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are of that Moment that we muſt ſuppoſe the Church cannot ſubſiſt if they be layed aſide; Therefore I will let that paſs, and humbly effer one thing, that I conceive will conduce greatly to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the differences that are amongſt us, and I am the more confident to propoſe it, becauſe altho it fail in this yet I hope that thing will appear <hi>reaſonable.</hi> In ſhort there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is this, that a <hi>Law</hi> be made to take away pluralities and <hi>non-reſidences:</hi> Not to have any retroſpect, for that I would not do, but to bar them for the future; For by theſe it is that much of our diviſions are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed and high laid, and I'le ſhew you how it comes to paſs: They who are bred up to be <hi>Miniſters</hi> are for the moſt part the Sons of ſuch parents, who are not capable of doing further for them than to maintain them at the Univerſity till they are capable to be admitted into a benefice: And when they have done that, they turn them off to provide for themſelves, who poſſibly have not five pounds in all the world, or a Croſs (as we ſay) to bleſs themſelves with;

               <pb n="464" facs="tcp:58538:150"/>So that being put to ſhift for themſelves, they find it difficult to get into a living, for when any Vacancy is, it is oftener ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Man that is beneficed already than by him that has none. Therefore what muſt he do, he has nothing to ſubſiſt on, he can get no preferment, he muſt not ſtarve; Work he cannot, to beg he is aſhamed, ſteal he dares not; what then is his refuge? There is no way left, but to inſinuate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the opinion of them that ſeparate from the Church, and to gain approbation, he muſt preach up a new fangled doctrine, and ſo gain to himſelf a people; And theſe he muſt be ſure to keep from the Church by ſpeaking againſt it and telling terrible ſtories of it, to fill them with fear and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions that they may not come at it; ſo that he is ſure that if he can give them a diſlike of the Church, their benevolences will be the more liberal and certain; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if room were made in Eccleſiaſtical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, by preventing pluralities and <hi>non-reſidencies,</hi> young <hi>Clergy men</hi> would not be ſo apt to turn aſide, becauſe they need not diſpair of preferment; I acknowledge this would not wholly cure our diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but I dare appeale to any reaſonable man, whether it would not go a great way in the work.</p>
            <p>But to let this paſs, I will proceed and mention a few things, and then let any man, if he can, Juſtify pluraliſts, and <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſidents;</hi> firſt, where do we find in Scripture
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:58538:150"/>that any one man had ſeveral flocks com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his care? Nay that of a Biſhop (which if allowable in any, ought to have the over-ſight of many congregations) yet they are confined to one Church, by the primitive inſtitution of them; when the <hi>Clergy</hi> made the work of the Miniſtry their buſineſs: Therefore I would fain be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, how it comes to paſs that the work of the Miniſtry is or ought to be leſs the care of the <hi>Clergy</hi> than heretofore: For ſo it is now adays, and it plainly appears by their Coveting Pluralities: For how can he that has ſeveral livings preach at them all; viſit and comfort the ſick, and do all the duties of him whoſe cares it is to watch for their Souls: And how unreaſonable a thing is it for one man to have five, ſix, perhaps more preferments, and five or ſix men of learning and Piety periſh for want of bread? It would make a man begin to think that Church preferments were ordained for theſe <hi>pluraliſts,</hi> and not deſign'd for every worthy <hi>labourer,</hi> who well deſerves his hire; beſides, not to ſay any thing of the <hi>Debauchery, Pride, Coveteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>contention</hi> of the <hi>Clergy;</hi> what a ſhame is it to ſee how theſe <hi>pluralists</hi> make choice of their <hi>Curates;</hi> their queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not, what is he? but how little will he take? as if piety and learning made no Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and were not requiſite; and if a good man be preferred to be a <hi>Curate,</hi> it is by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, and not by deſign: And therefore I humbly conceive that the diviſions of our
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:58538:151"/>Church are not a little <hi>occaſioned</hi> by this, and contempt brought upon it: And is it not ſad to think that men ſhall be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Church, upon the account of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and not for Merit; This being ſo plain I will not multiply words upon it, but conclude with this, that every mans <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> is to do <hi>Juſtly, love Mercy and to Walk humbly with God, to believe in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and not to put our brethren out of the Church, for which God Almighty will not ſhut Heavens Gates againſt us.</hi>

            <p>THe preſervation of the publick peace is the occaſion that has called us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at this time, in which no man can be remiſs or neglect, when he conſiders that his particular intereſt, as well as his duty, does indiſpenſibly oblige him to do what in him lyes to ſupport it; In order to this, that which is now more eſpecially expected from us is, firſt, To inquire into the neglects of thoſe in whom the Law has repoſed any truſt, and Second, to diſcover thoſe who have broken or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the Laws, that ſuch criminals may be brought to condign puniſhment. And ſince the execution of the Laws is our proper buſineſs, and that the Laws ſhould have their courſe, is abſolutely neceſſary to the
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:58538:152"/>being of the Government; It may not be impertinent, as I conceive at this time, to ſay ſomething of the Nature of Government, and particularly of our own conſtitution; or rather it ſeems neceſſary to take all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to explain it, conſidering, what varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of opinions there is amongſt us of that which is or ought to be the Supreme autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or power in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many wiſe and learned men have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the Nature of Government, and given excellent definitions of it; but of all others <hi>Plato</hi> ſeems to me to have done it in the feweſt and plaineſt words, which are theſe: <q>Government, or Law, ſays he, is to preſerve the huge and indigeſted lump of a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and to bring all diſorder into propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo as to become an harmony.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And Next to him is; the learned <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſays, that it is a rational ordinance for the advancing of the publick good; Several others have ſpoken to the ſame purpoſe, which I omit, becauſe I will be as little te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious as I can; Two things I have obſerved from hence, firſt, That order and peace is or ought to be the end of every Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; And ſecond, That in every <hi>Government</hi> there is ſome particular principle that runs through the whole Scheme of that Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that as that principle is followed or neglected, ſo accordingly it goes ill or well with the publick; that is, when thoſe who are intruſted with the executive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er do purſue that principle, every thing
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:58538:152"/>moves regularly, and the Government is firm and ſtable: But when they ſteer by any other Meaſures, the State does unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably fall into diſorders and Convulſions; and that whoever he be that is placed at the head of the Government, if he deſires to have the Hearts and Prayers of his People, whilſt he lives, and that after-Ages ſhall bleſs his Memory; It is neceſſary firſt, <hi>That in general he reſolve to Govern well:</hi> And Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>Throughly and rightly to apprize him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of that principle that is the Soul of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> or at leaſt-that he be adviſed by ſuch as are moſt likely to know it, and will give him faithful Counſel: Otherwiſe, he will be like a Traveller, that in the Night miſſes his way upon ſome large Plain, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering he knows not whither, and is more likely to meet with ſome diſaſter than to find his way.</p>
            <p>Having ſaid this, it is natural for you to expect that I ſhould tell you what that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is, which is the Life and Foundation of this Government.</p>
            <p>If I am not much miſtaken, and I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily perſwaded that I am not, I take it to be this. That every Subject of <hi>England</hi> has ſo clear a property in his Life, Goods, and Eſtate, and every thing elſe which he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes; that they cannot be taken from him, nor ought he to be diſturbed in the Injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them without his voluntary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or for ſome Offence againſt the Law. And in the next Place, that there be not a
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:58538:153"/>Failure in <hi>Juſtice,</hi> that is, <hi>That no man be left without remedy where his Right is concern'd, and that every Criminal be pun ſht according to the Demerits of his Offence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am apt to believe, that every man will think, that this is very agreeable to Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reaſon, and then I don't ſee how it can be inconſiſtent with the <hi>Prerogative</hi> of the <hi>Crown,</hi> altho' I know, that not very long ſince, and I fear yet there are ſome, who carry the Prerogative much higher, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it above the Law, but nothing, ſave the Iniquity of the times, and the Depravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſuch mens Manners could ſupport or give Countenance to ſo ſenſeleſs a thought; For they are very ignorant of the Nature of <hi>Prerogative,</hi> if they think it is a Powet to do Hurt, and not to do Good: Certainly the <hi>Kings Prerogative</hi> is to help and relieve the People, where the Edge of the Law is too ſharp and keen, and not a Power by which he may Oppreſs and Deſtroy his Subjects: Men are to be Govern'd by a Power that is guided by Reaſon, unleſs we can ſuppoſe they have no more under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and are of no greater Value than the Beaſts that Periſh.</p>
            <p>It was ſaid by one who was a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judge in the Caſe, as I remember it was Sir <hi>John Forteſcue,</hi> 
               <q>That it is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Power in a <hi>Prince</hi> to be reſtrained by Law, from oppreſſing, than to have an abſolute Regal Power.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And ſays another great Author, <hi>The way
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:58538:153"/>if Governing muſt be both right and clear, as well as is the End:</hi> And how this can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected when a King is guided by no other Rule than that of his Will and Pleaſure, I don't ſee, no more than that a man can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Weather.</p>
            <p>Does not all the Examples of it, that ever were, prove, that abſolute Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Oppreſſion, are inſeparable, and the one as naturally proceeds from the other, as the Effect does from the Cauſe.</p>
            <p>It's a Riddle to me, how that Prince can be called <hi>Gods Ordinance,</hi> who aſſumes a Power above what the Law has inveſted him with to the grieving and oppreſſing of his Subjects. May not the Plague, Famine or Sword as well be called Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, ſince one no leſs than the other is ſent by him, for the Puniſhment of that People he ſo Viſits.</p>
            <p>We may reaſonably ſuppoſe, that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Peace is much rather the End of Government, than Oppreſſion and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, becauſe God is a God of Order; and when he ſent the greateſt Bleſſing upon Earth, it was Peace: and tho' God was often very wrath with the Kings of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> for their Idolatry, yet the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Blood that they ſhed, and the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Oppreſſion which they commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, provoked him more highly, and with his ſevereſt Judgements has always teſtity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Diſpleaſure againſt it.</p>
            <pb n="470" facs="tcp:58538:154"/>
            <p>I could run out into a large Diſcourſe upon this Subject, but I will ſtop here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am perſwaded that what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid is ſufficient to convince any one that is unprejudiced, That an abſolute Power is ſo far from being the Right of a King of <hi>England,</hi> that the exerciſe of ſuch a Power is unlawful in any King.</p>
            <p>I know very well, that in the late Reigns this Doctrine would not have been indured, to have ſaid leſs than this would have loſt a man his head: For whoever would not comply with Arbitrary power, was called <hi>Factious, and an oppoſer of the Government.</hi> But is it not Nonſence, or very near a Kin to it, to call that Seditious, that is for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things into Order, and fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Arbitary Doctrine</hi> never did any <hi>King</hi> good, but has ruined many, it ſhook <hi>King Charles</hi> the ſeconds Throne, and tumbled down his next Succeſſour; and tho' ſuch Kings are left without excuſe when ruined, yet I may ſay they only are not in fault; for their Overthrow is in a great part occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by thoſe, who Preach up, and adviſe the King to Arbitrary Power: Did not other People cocker up and cheriſh Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Notions in the Peoples mind; tho' ſuch conceptions might ſometimes get into his head, yet they would never Fructify and come to Perfection, if they were not Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated by Paraſites, who make their Court that way, in hopes to make themſelves
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:58538:154"/>great, tho' with the hazard of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters <hi>Crown:</hi> As it befell K. <hi>James,</hi> whoſe <hi>Male-Adminiſtration</hi> rendred him unmeet to ſway the Scepter; and I am very well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed that his Judgment was juſt, for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a People are decreed to be miſerable, which <hi>God Almighty</hi> will never do, except thereto provoked by their Sins, certainly he will never ſo tye up their hands, that they ſhall not be allow'd to uſe them, when they have no other way to help themſelves.</p>
            <p>Several <hi>Artifices</hi> were made uſe of in the two late Reigns for the introducing Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Power. One of which was, to inſinuate into the minds of the People, <hi>That the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Crown was the chief Pillar of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> and that the breaking into it upon any pretence whatſoever, was no leſs than a Diſſolution of the whole Conſtitution, and nothing but Diſorder and Confuſion would enſue.</p>
            <p>This Doctrine prevailed with many, and obtained no leſs than, if the Crown had been ſettled in that Family, by an <hi>Ordinance</hi> or <hi>Decree,</hi> dropt from Heaven, and that every one of that Line or Race had been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſht from the reſt of mankind by more than ordinary Virtues, and Indowments of Mind and Body: But we know not of any ſuch Divine Revelation; and happy had it been, if that Family had been ſo ſignal for its Juſtice and Piety; we might then have prayed, <hi>that there might not want one of them to ſit upon the Throne to all Ages.</hi> How much
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:58538:155"/>this Nation is obliged to that Family we very well Remember, for the Wounds they gave us are not yet healed.</p>
            <p>Election was certainly the Original of Succeſſion, for as the Living more ſafely, and with the freer enjoyment of their Goods was the Original Cauſe that people Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves into a Nation or Kingdom; ſo for the better attaining that End, did they ſet over themſelves, the beſt and Wiſeſt of their Brethren to be their Rulers and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, and this Adminiſtration was truſted in one or more hands, according to the temper and Diſpoſition of the People, in which Authority they continued, either for their Lives, or for one Year, or ſome other ſtated Period of time: Where the Government was under a King, he uſually held it for Life, and then upon his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe, the People proceeded to a new Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, till at laſt it fell into the hand of ſome very excellent Perſon, who having more than Ordinarily deſerved of his Country; they as well in Gratitude to him, as believing they could not expect a better Choice, than in the Branches that would grow out of ſo excellent a Stock, entailed that Dignity upon him and his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity. This ſeems to be the moſt natural and Lawful riſe of Succeſſion; I don't deny but ſome Succeſſions have ariſen from force, but that was never laſting, for that could not ſubſiſt or ſeem lawful longer than there was a force to ſupport it: Now thoſe that
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:58538:155"/>come to the <hi>Crown</hi> by the firſt way of Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, I mean by the conſent and approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the People, does it not plainly imply, that they ought to uſe that power, for the good and advantage of their Subjects, and not to their hurt, and enjoy their Crown only upon that condition, no man would ever ſuffer a Monſter to inherit his Eſtate, and Kings are no more exempted from the Accidents of Nature, than their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Subjects, and it is every days practice in private Families to exclude thoſe that will waſte their Eſtate, and ruine the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and if the Reaſon will there hold good, then it is ſo much ſtronger in the deſcent of the Crown, by how much the good of a whole Kingdom is to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to that of one private Family.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Succeſſion</hi> is not ſo very ancient in <hi>England</hi> as ſome People may apprehend, till the time of <hi>William Primus,</hi> commonly called the <hi>Conqueror,</hi> it was lookt upon as a very precarious Title: The next in Succeſſion could reckon very little upon the Crown, further than his good Inclinations and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency to Sway the <hi>Scepter,</hi> did recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him, it being then very common, not only to break into the Succeſſion, but even to ſet aſide all that Family and Line, when ever it was found that the Publick might ſuffer by their being at the head of the Government; the Publick Good being the only Rule and Conſideration that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd that point.</p>
            <pb n="474" facs="tcp:58538:156"/>
            <p>
               <hi>William Primus</hi> upon his Death-bed decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that he did not poſſeſs the <hi>Crown</hi> by an Hereditary Right.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Heary Primus</hi> in his Charter acknowleged to hold his Crown by the Mercy of God, and the Common Council.</p>
            <p>K. <hi>Stephen, Henry</hi> 2d, <hi>Rich. Primus,</hi> and <hi>King John</hi> all came in by Election, ſo that till <hi>Henry</hi> 3d. there is ſcarcely to be found any Precedent of Succeſſion; ſince his time, the Succeſſion has been broke into ſeveral times, and the Crown ſhifted from one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily to another by Act of Parliament, and being ſo transferred by that Authority, is the greateſt Proof that can be, that Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion is a very feeble Title without ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to ſupport it, and I think I may ſay Defective: For ſays one of great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, <hi>Never did any take pains to obtain an Act of Parliament to ſettle his Inheritance on his Heirs, except he were an Alien or Illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate;</hi> and therefore conſidering, That by vertue of an Intail of the Crown by Act of <hi>Parliament</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the Sevenths time, it is that the four laſt Kings have ſwayed this Scepter. I could never underſtand that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right, that was by ſome ſtampt upon their Title to the Crown, or that the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion was preferrable to the Publick Good.</p>
            <p>I have endeavoured to explain this point, the more, by reaſon that ſome object againſt the ſufficiency of <hi>This Kings Title to
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:58538:156"/>the Crown,</hi> becauſe the Succeſſion was broke through to let him into the Throne, as if nothing could give a King a good Title to the Crown but <hi>Succeſſion:</hi> For my part I never ſaw any reaſon to be of that Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and if there be nothing but the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Succeſſion to object to this Kings Right; if he continue to govern according to the Principle upon which the <hi>Crown</hi> was given him, and according to the laudable Cuſtoms of the Realm, I think that every man that wiſhes well to the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of his Country, ought to bleſs God for this Revolution.</p>
            <p>In my poor Opinion, I do not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, that a King who comes to the Crown by Election, ſhould think worſe of his Title than if he had come in by Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor that the People ſhould ſuſpect that they hold their Properties and Rights more precariouſly under a King that is Elected, than under one that claims the Crown by Succeſſion, but rather the contrary. For the People are under a more immediate Obligation to ſtand by, and ſupport the King they have Elected, than any other that takes the Crown by Succeſſion; and on the other hand, it more highly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powers him, as well in point of Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, as policy, to preſerve the good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the People, by Governing well, than if his Title were by Succeſſion; For I am far from believing that a King who comes in by Election, may make more bold
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:58538:157"/>with the Laws, than he that claims under any other Title, or that his <hi>Right to the Crown,</hi> continues longer than by his Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration it does appear that his Intereſt is the ſame with that of the Nation.</p>
            <p>The next Deceit by which the Nation was to be gulled into <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery,</hi> was by <hi>fomenting Diviſions among Proteſtants,</hi> and eſpecially about the Terms of <hi>Communion,</hi> making them ſo ſtrict and narrow as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the greater part of the <hi>Proteſtants in England,</hi> and four parts in ten of the reſt in the World. That this was not to promote Gods Glory and Salvation of mens Souls, but to ſerve ſome wicked Deſign, is clear to me for theſe Reaſons:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe the <hi>Laws against Diſſenters</hi> were ſtretcht and executed beyond their genuine and Natural Intent or Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Where fair play is intended, ſuch Tricks are altogether needleſs, but dayly experience proves, that when they are made uſe of, ſomething elſe is deſigned than what is pretended. True Religion needs no ſuch Methods to ſupport it, the Nature of which is Peace and Charity: And beſides ſuch forc'd Conſtructions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing leſs than <hi>Summum Jus,</hi> are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred by our Law, and it terms it to be no leſs than the higheſt Injuſtice.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second Reaſon</hi> for my Opinion is, becauſe that ſeveral Laws were put in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution againſt the Diſſenters, which are plainly and directly made for other purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:58538:157"/>by which the Law it ſelf ſuffered Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and ſo made it evident to every man that had a mind to ſee, that ſome foul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and not the Church, was at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Another Reaſon is this, Becauſe more diligence and care was imployed to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh people for <hi>Nonconformity,</hi> than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their Lives and Manners: For if a man was never ſo openly wicked and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched, and Scarcely, if ever, ſaw the inſide of a Church, yet if he could talk aloud, and ſwagger for the Church, &amp; ſtorm againſt and pull <hi>Diſſenters</hi> in pieces; he was cryed up as a good Son of the Church, an honeſt man, and truly affected to the <hi>Government;</hi> whilſt thoſe who could not come up to the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies injoyned by the <hi>Rubrick,</hi> tho' their Lives in all other reſpects were upright, and their Converſation unblamable, yet were called Villains and Rogues, and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the <hi>Government,</hi> as if the outſide and Ceremonious part of Religion, was more to be valued than the Subſtance and Eſſence of it, which puts me in mind of a <hi>Play,</hi> where this Nonſenſical Zeal is very well expoſed, <hi>Spaniſh Fryer.</hi>—</p>
            <p>I could never yet meet with any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in all the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> that does juſtify ſuch Proceedings, as I have mentioned, but there are ſeveral that expreſly condemn it: to me it ſeems altogether inconſiſtent with the Charity, which is expected to be found in all thoſe that hope to enter into Heaven, and it ſeems to be little leſs than teaching for
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:58538:158"/>Doctrine, the Traditions of Men, and to add to <hi>Gods</hi> word, which is prohibited, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no leſs a penalty than that of Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>I am far from being againſt Order and Decency to be obſerved in the <hi>Church,</hi> yet under that pretence we are not to forget the Rule of <hi>Charity;</hi> and I cannot ſee wherefore thoſe things ſhould be made Terms of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion:</hi> That are not Terms of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>I was always of that Opinion, that it would never go well with <hi>England,</hi> till every man might worſhip <hi>God</hi> in his own way, for nothing can be more unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable than to expect a man ſhould believe otherwiſe than according to the Conviction that is upon him: And therefore I cannot but wonder at thoſe who take Offence at the <hi>Act of Indulgence,</hi> which tends ſo much to our peace by quieting the Minds of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as to their Religion, which has ever been the handle for our <hi>Intestine Troubles,</hi> the Incendiaries of the State having ever made uſe of it, as the beſt pretence to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broil the Nation; and therefore I for my part do think, the <hi>Act of Indulgence</hi> was a neceſſary and pious Work; and cannot imagine why any man ſhould think that to be a Diſſervice to the <hi>Church,</hi> that tends to the Peace of the Nation; they that do, I muſt believe they are not much concerned in the <hi>Cauſe of the Church and their Country,</hi>
               <pb n="475" facs="tcp:58538:158"/>and care not what is uppermoſt, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they can make fair Weather for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> if any ſpeak to the Diſadvantage of the <hi>Act of Indulgence,</hi> you ought to preſent them as diſaffected to the <hi>Government,</hi> and Sowers of the Seed of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in the State.</p>
            <p>But I deſire to be rightly underſtood, I don't ſay this to diſwade any man from coming to the Church, for I go conſtantly thither my ſelf; I wiſh every Body could do it as eaſily as I do, and I wonder it is otherwiſe, for I never yet heard any good reaſon for practicing the contrary; yet I think unleſs a man be ſatisfyed in that way of Worſhip, it is better to keep away than to come, for otherwiſe it is to mock, and not to ſerve <hi>God;</hi> and on the other hand it is no leſs a mocking of <hi>God,</hi> when a man from an over Aſſurance of the gift of Prayer; ſhall adventure to Pray in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, without having before-hand well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted his Matter and Words, and thereby happen to let fall crude &amp; naucious Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſuch as would be ridiculous in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; for I am far from believing that Nonſence can be the Effect of Fervency, but rather of Affection, or ſomething that is very deſpicable.</p>
            <p>And here it will not be improper to take Notice of thoſe Perſons who go to no Church at all, but ſpend the <hi>Sunday</hi> in an <hi>Ale-houſe,</hi> or otherways idle it away very
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:58538:159"/>unprofitably. Againſt ſuch as theſe was that Law of <hi>Twelve pence per Sunday</hi> intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and were it duly put in Execution, a great deal of that diſhonour that is done to <hi>God</hi> by ſuch Prophanation, would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, and the poor would be relieved with leſs charge to their reſpective Pariſhes. I wonder that the petty Conſtables are not more careful to make a true Preſentment at every petty Seſſions, of thoſe that herein of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, the <hi>Glory of God</hi> and their own Intereſt being ſo immediatly concerned; therefore <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I doubt not but you will do your beſt to reform this great Evil.</p>
            <p>The next thing I would recommend to you, is as far as in you lyes, to ſuppreſs that horrible ſin of <hi>Cuſtomary Swearing.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the tremendous Name of <hi>God</hi> is every day Blaſphemed. It's too true that ſcarcely any man when provokt, or in paſſion, but its too apt to take the Name of <hi>God</hi> into his mouth, and if any of us fall into that misfortune, we ought ſolemnly to beg Forgivenneſs for it; but that whereby <hi>God's</hi> Honour ſuffers moſt, is the <hi>Cuſtomary Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> when men don't think that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs themſelves handſomely, without an horrible Oath or more in every Sentence. Thus the petty Conſtables ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent at every Months Meeting, and if you know any have neglected to do their Duty herein, I hope you won't fail to let us know their Names, that we may puniſh them as they deſerve.</p>
            <pb n="481" facs="tcp:58538:159"/>
            <p>It is a very ſhameful thing to ſee how very much the <hi>High-ways</hi> are generally out of repair; the fault of which does moſtly lye at the door of the <hi>Overſeers,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not eaſily puniſht are very remiſs, and take no further care than to Shufflle the Matter off for their time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not much concern'd for what comes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and by this means brings at laſt a great Burthen upon the Townſhip, which would have been prevented by a ſmall thing, if taken in time, and ſo the Townſhip ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers for their Neglect. This, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> is worthy your care, to preſent the Defaults in High Ways.</p>
            <p>There are very good Laws againſt Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds, but the Execution of them are ſhamefully neglected, and its ſtrange it ſhould be ſo; conſidering that the Law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courages the apprehending of ſuch idle people; For whoever brings one of thoſe Wanderers before a Juſtice of the Peace, the Townſhip through which he laſt paſt unpuniſht is to pay him two Shillings, tho' this reward carry no weight with it, yet the great Miſchief that thoſe ſort of people bring upon the publick, ſhould make eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body Vigilant; It is an incredible Sum that they coſt the Nation in a Year, and how many Townſhips and Pariſhes are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt and almoſt ruined, by the Charge thoſe people bring opon them: It is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, that people ſhould rather chooſe to forſwear themſelves, than do their Duty:
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:58538:160"/>But ſo it is in this Caſe. If theſe Wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers were duely puniſht, it would reform many of them, and diſcourage them from following ſo bad an Example, whereas the great remiſſneſs of Conſtables and other Officers in this point, is a great Temptation to many who otherwiſe would think of ſome more lawful Imployment; a neglect and ſlowneſs to puniſh, increaſes the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Offenders.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is a very common ſaying, <hi>That Intereſt will not lye,</hi> and yet if you conſider it you will find, that there is ſcarcely any thing more difficult, than to perſwade People to their Intereſt, a thing mightily to be wiſht; becauſe if it were univerſally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood and practiced, it is the thing of all others that would make this World a happy place, for then there would be no need of Laws and Magiſtrates to preſerve Peace and good Order, by reaſon that every man would be reſtrained by that Law within himſelf, which is the Foundation of all other Laws, I mean that Principle of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Juſtice with which he is Born.</p>
            <pb n="484" facs="tcp:58538:161"/>
            <p>But when man fell from his primitive Innocency, he loſt that guide which ſhould happily have conducted him through this World; and inſtead of following the dictates of his Reaſon, he ſuffered himſelf to be led away by his paſſions; and without any regard to Juſtice, made his Self-Intereſt the Standard of his Dealings with others; which is the direct way to ruine that which he aimed at; for if a man acts without regard of Juſtice to others, he has little rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to expect that Juſtice ſhould be done him; for why ſhould he imagine that others ſhould take care to do him right, who has no other Conſideration but for himſelf: So that in point of Intereſt as well as Juſtice, every man ought to have a Mutual regard to the good of each other; and becauſe it is ſo intirely neglected, therefore were Laws made to withold men from commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoſe Acts of Injuſtice and Violence, which their own Conſciences tells them ought not to be done.</p>
            <p>From this depraved Inclination, do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed all thoſe Diſturbances and Diſorders, that infeſt any Government; and have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten been fatal to the whole Conſtitution; There having at all times, and in all places been ſound thoſe who have been diſpoſed to Sacrifice their Liberties and Civil Rights, to ſerve the deſires and luſts of Arbitrary Princes.</p>
            <p>It is ſurely a great Sickneſs of the mind, when a man gives up his Birth-right, in
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:58538:161"/>exchange for ſomething that depends upon another mans Breath; and he muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide his Wits, who lightly eſteems his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, which is the thing that chiefly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhes him from a Beaſt; for when a man is a Slave, he muſt ſubmit his Will and Reaſon to the Humor of him who Governs him; and then what difference is there betwixt him and a Brute, only that his Condition is the worſt of the two.</p>
            <p>If no body but themſelves were to feel the Effects of the Servile Compliance, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were not much, if they periſhed by their own Folly, for why ſhould they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to thrive better than <hi>Eſau</hi> did, <hi>who ſold his Birthright to ſave his Life,</hi> and therefore, <hi>inſtead of a Bleſſing, received a Curſe:</hi> For can they who reject God's Mercy hope to intail a Bleſſing upon their Poſterity: theſe are the <hi>Sower Grapes</hi> that ſet the Childrens Teeth on Edge, for tho' the Father may be ſo fortunate as to go to his Grave in his Princes Favour, a happineſs to which few have attained, who have purchaſed it by being falſe to their Country, yet it is a <hi>Dargerous Experiment for his Poſterity,</hi> to whom there is ſeldom left any thing more than to inherit the Wind.</p>
            <p>Now, If the Miſchief of this Time-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had ended with this ſort of Men and their Poſterity, the <hi>Complaints</hi> againſt it might have been buried with them and their Families, for his Infamy ought to be
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:58538:162"/>had in Remembrance ſo long as the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> indure, who is the Inſtrument of his Countrys ruine; for by this Treachery has whole Kingdoms been brought to deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which before were in a flouriſhing Condition? Juſtice was duely executed, full Employment for all hands, a quick Trade, and every man ſate with Security and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure under his own Vine.</p>
            <p>This is ſo deplorable a Change, as no Tongue is able to expreſs, then let every man conſider it in his own Thoughts, and he will diſcover how valuable a thing his Liberty is, even preſerable to any thing elſe this World affords; For Liberty is the Foundation of Virtue and Induſtry; what does any thing elſe ſignify without it? For when that is gone, as our Lives and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes depend upon another mans pleaſure, ſo we hold our Religion as precariouſly; becauſe a Prince can impoſe upon Slaves, what Religion he pleaſes. <hi>France</hi> is ſo pregnant an Inſtance of this, that it puts the thing out of Diſpute; For while the <hi>Protestants</hi> kept their <hi>Liberties</hi> all was well with them; yet no ſooner was that wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted out of their hands, but it was quickly ſeen what became of their Religion.</p>
            <p>I have always thought, that they began at the wrong End, who reckoned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of all other danger whilſt they enjoyed the Exerciſe of their Religion; it will not be denyed, but that <hi>Liberty</hi> is a
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:58538:162"/>great Security to the free Exerciſe of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but if our <hi>Civil Rights</hi> are aſſaulted, I don't ſee by what means Religion can reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue them out of Violent hands: Beſides there are many Inſtances, where Religion has been uſed as a Stalking Horſe to enſlave a Nation: For did ever any Man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have a greater concern for the Church than <hi>Charles the</hi> 2d. and yet no man more deſigned the Ruine or the Nation than he did; which Example may occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the People to ſuſpect ſome Deſign upon their <hi>Liberties,</hi> when the Prince pretends the greateſt Care for Religion, unleſs he be a man of great Morality, and Religion appear in his Life and Practice, as well as in his Words and Promiſes: For it is ſcarce paſſible to inſlave a free People by direct Force, and therefore they muſt be gulled out of their <hi>Liberty,</hi> by Art, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhand Practice, and there cannot be a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter blind (than a pretended care for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion) to keep the people from obſerving what is deſigned againſt them.</p>
            <p>So that if any thing is worthy of their Care, it is their Liberty, and in doing ſo, you do the part of Loyal Subjects, and good Chriſtians, whereas by the neglect of it, you expoſe every thing that is valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; ſo you alſo lay a ſnare in the way of your Prince, thereby tempting him to think of that which otherwiſe might not have come into his Thoughts.</p>
            <pb n="488" facs="tcp:58538:163"/>
            <p>And this Care is never to be neglected, not even when any thing goes to their hearts Deſire, leſt whilſt you ſpeak Peace to your ſelves, there comes upon you ſudden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: For a Deſign is more likely to take effect when people ſuſpect no ſuch thing, than when they ſtand upon their Guard.</p>
            <p>There are many ways of Working Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple up into a Security, of all which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miles are the moſt fatal; for without Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance they become Snares, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is upon Actions and not upon words, that a Wiſe Man will ground his Belief or Opinion. Conſider what is done, and not what is ſaid; for whoever he be that is ſo wicked as to have a Deſign of inſlaving the Nation, he will never make a difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of promiſing very largely.</p>
            <p>If then we ought to take care of our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, how ridiculous is it to talk of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Crown, when by that is meant, <hi>To make the Kings Will and Pleaſure the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their Obedience;</hi> it muſt be a mere Nonſenſical Boaſt to talk at that rate, when they have ſtript themſelves of the means of Serving like Rational Creatures; for when men have given up their Liberty, what does all their Service to the Crown differ from that of a Beaſt. The Service that we do for our Prince, ſhould be like that which we render unto God, not a forc't and conſtrained, but a free and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Service.</p>
            <pb n="489" facs="tcp:58538:163"/>
            <p>So that I think I may ſay, That he who hopes to recommend himſelf to his Princes Favour, by ſuch a piece of Service, muſt needs be a very profligate Wretch, and believe his Prince to be altogether ſuch a one as himſelf; For ſuch a deſign is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unlawful, becauſe it is deſtructive to the Nature and End of Government, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Kings Coronation Oath, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with Reaſon, and a Violation of that Truſt and Confidence which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple repoſe in the King; For as I take it, The Power that is lodged in the Crown, is only a Truſt, and nothing more, for he muſt have that Power either as a Truſt or a Property; and if he holds it as a Property, then no Bounds or Limits can be ſet to it, and he may uſe it as to him ſhall ſeem moſt meet; What will Laws then ſignify? To what purpoſe is the Coronation Oath, and all thoſe other Cautions that are taken to oblige the King to Govern according to the Laws and laudable Cuſtoms of the Realm, and then every Prince that has been Depoſed for committing Violence and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, was highly injured, for there would be no other Standard of Right and Wrong, but that of his Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: But it is a common Practice, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Kings when they become a Burthen to the People, that being the proper and only remedy in ſuch Caſes. For let any man tell me, if he can, whether the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:58538:164"/>that remains in the World, has been or can be preſerved by any other Means, than by that Power that is uſed in the people, of laying aſide ſuch Kings whoſe Adminiſtrations become exorbitant. For the Number of ill Kings exceeds ſo much that of the good ones, that Liberty had been before this day ſwallowed by <hi>Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> without ſome ſuch check; and becauſe ſo very much good or hurt is in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Prince, the value of a good King is ineſtimable.</p>
            <p>To be delivered out of the Hands of an Oppreſſing King, is a great Mercy, yet ſuch a price when put into the Hands of any People is ſeldom improved as it ought to be. For <hi>Tacitus</hi> makes this Obſervation upon the Fall of <hi>Nero, That the firſt day after the Reign of a Tyrant is always the beſt.</hi> This is a great Truth, and a Rule that has no exception.</p>
            <p>For this ſeveral Reaſons may be given, For generally the people are ſo tranſported upon being eaſed of their Burthen, that they neglect to make ſuch proviſions as are neceſſary to prevent the like Irregularities for the Future; either from belief, that no other man will be Wicked to the like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, or elſe from the fond Opinion that they conceive of him, who was the chief Inſtrument of their Deliverance, truſting that the ſame Principle of Honour and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice that incited him to ſtand up in their Defence, will prompt him to do all thoſe
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:58538:164"/>things that are needful to ſettle the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon a laſting Foundation: Which was ſomething our Caſe upon the Reſtorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of King <hi>Charles</hi> 2d. only with this Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that inſtead of Repairing the Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which his Father had made, the miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Loyalty of the Age, helpt to make them wider.</p>
            <p>Another Reaſon for <hi>Tacitus</hi> his Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be this; Becauſe the chief Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Deliverance, altho' he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared very zealous on their behalf, yet he aimed at nothing but getting the <hi>Crown;</hi> as it was when the <hi>Dauphine of France</hi> came over to aſſiſt the <hi>Barons</hi> againſt King <hi>John,</hi> his Declaration was full of nothing elſe but the <hi>Engliſh Liberties,</hi> yet it afterwards ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared that his Deſign in aſſiſting them, was only to get into the Throne, and not to eaſe the Nations Oppreſſion; ſo that in ſuch Caſes a Revolution does the People no good, for he that has got the Crown, thinks that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is done for the Good and Security of the People, is ſo much loſt to him, of what he hoped to get by coming over.</p>
            <p>A third Reaſon may be this; Becauſe he may preſume upon the good Opinion the People have of him; ſuppoſing that they will put the beſt Conſtruction upon all he does, and look upon thoſe things to be but Miſtakes, and conſequence of want of Information, which are the reſult of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid Deſign.</p>
            <p>Or elſe, becauſe he may Imagine, that
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:58538:165"/>altho' he does to a great degree act over the Part of him, who was thruſt out of the Throne, yet that the People will not feel the laſh ſo ſencibly, becauſe it comes from his hand. This, when ever it happens, is a thing of ſo foul a Complexion, that it deſerves as ill a name as can be given it, and yet I fear there does not want Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of it.</p>
            <p>It is a Miſtake, and a dangerous one, to conſider the Perſon more than the thing that is done; as if the perſon made the thing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or worſe than it otherwiſe would be: Men indeed differ from one another, and do the ſame thing in different ways and manners, but yet every thing is ſtill the ſame, whoever he be that does it; if there be any difference it lyes in this, that the better Reputation he has, who does an ill thing, ſo much the greater is his Reproach, eſpecially if it be a thing that he has repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and puniſht in another. This Judging the thing by the Perſon, is that by which commonly men deceive themſelves ſo very much, or elſe they would make a righter Judgment than for the moſt part they do.</p>
            <p>How happy is that Prince then, whilſt he is on this ſide the Grave, and how glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious will be his Memory, who is not afraid or ſhy to have his Actions examined; that mankind, as well as his own Conſcience, may bear him Teſtimony, that he Governs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:58538:165"/>to Law, and makes the good of his People the End of his Government?</p>
            <p>Before I proceed any further, I would be rightly underſtood in what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid; becauſe, poſſibly either through Miſtake or Malice, ſome may infer that I would perſwade you to take more care of your Liberty than of Religion, by reaſon that I have ſaid ſo much of the former. But far be ſo <hi>Atheiſtical</hi> a thought from me; I bleſs God, it never yet entred into my heart, altho' I am not ſo Religious as I ought to be, yet I think our Religion to be more valuable than any other thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, for if God ſhould take away the Light of his Goſpel from us, it would be the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Judgment that he could viſit us with, and have therefore preſſed you to take care of your Liberty, as the ſureſt means by which you can preſerve your Religion, and in ſo doing I conceive I have ſhown a Zeal rather than a neglect of it.</p>
            <p>It is to be wiſht by all thoſe who deſire the Peace of their Country, <hi>that Religion were more in faſhion than it is:</hi> For no Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ever did thrive where it was neglected, and it is to be feared, that God will have a controverſie with this Land, if Swearing and Drinking, which are now become ſo common, be not ſpeedily ſuppreſſed, and the Corrupt Manners of the Nation reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>But before I ſpeak more particularly upon them, give me leave to obſerve ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:58538:166"/>thing to you, upon two things which are very injurious to Religion, and yet are done out of a pretended care and tenderneſs for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The First is,</hi> When <hi>Proteſtants</hi> break into ſeveral Sects, and diſtinct Congregations; and not being content with Worſhiping God in their own way, are uneaſy at all others who follow not with them. Every one being aſſured that they are not miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that they will not allow any but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to be in the right; and thereby leave the excellent Rule of Charity; to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a blind Infallibility.</p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed, whileſt we are upon Earth, we ſhall have different Sentiments and Opinions, and it is not poſſible for me to help it, becauſe our Reaſon is ſo ſhort ſighted and Pur-blind: But yet we may all agree to have a mutual Charity for one another; and then every man will be the better for his Religion, and no body will be the worſe for it; For otherwiſe inſtead of promoting Religion, we eat out the Bowels of it, that is, we deſtroy that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, without which we cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. But alas! it is come to this, That one is for <hi>Paul,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for <hi>Apollo,</hi> and a third for <hi>Caephas.</hi> One asks of ſuch a one, <hi>Is he a Son of the Church?</hi> a ſecond inquires, <hi>Whether he is of ſuch a Congregation?</hi> A third demands, <hi>to know if he follows ſuch a man,</hi> if ſo all is well, and with them he muſt paſs for a good man,
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:58538:166"/>without examining into his Life and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.</p>
            <p>But what does all this amount to? am I the better for being of ſuch a man's Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, or of ſuch a Communion, unleſs I am a Doer, as well as a Hearer of the Word? Or what is another man the worſe, becauſe I am not of his own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, if he live a better life than I do?</p>
            <p>This Zeal for a Party, is a Zeal rather to be reproved than to invite others to the practice of it; for it is not an Argument of Religion, but a ſign of <hi>Phariſaical</hi> pride, when a man is uneaſy with another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he worſhips God in a way different from him. For if any man deſire to live becoming the Goſpel of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and to that End does daily try and examine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he will find more to be amiſs there than he can diſcover in others; and therefore to lead a good Life is the beſt Argument that any man can uſe to perſwade another to be of his Opinion.</p>
            <p>The next thing which is Injurious to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is when the Diſcipline and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church interferes with the State, breaking into the Methods and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of it, and to advance the Power and greatneſs of the Clergy.</p>
            <p>This ſoon becomes Miſchievous to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; For as it does in no ſort prompt God's Glory, or tend to the reforming of Mens manners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When the People find their Liberties Crouded, to make El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:58538:167"/>Room for the Clergy, and that the Government of the Church will help to make them Slaves, they will be very apt to abhor the Offerings of the Lord.</p>
            <p>And therefore, in all well regulated Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, the <hi>Government of the Church</hi> is moulded according to the Principle upon which the Civil Government ſtands, for if the <hi>Church</hi> were to Model the <hi>State,</hi> Chriſt's Kingdom would be of this World, which he has expreſly told us is not.</p>
            <p>Is not that People then in a ſad conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when, that what is amiſs in the State muſt not be Reformed, for fear of hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Church, as ſome do vainly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend. This I ſay, becauſe I am afraid it is ſomething our Caſe at this time, and ſo the Nation muſt languiſh, to ſatisfy the Imagin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ions of ſome People who are afraid of their Shadows.</p>
            <p>How the Church can be hurt by any Laws that concern the State, is not eaſily to be comprehended, if thoſe Laws Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh no other Goſpel than that which was delivered by our Saviour.</p>
            <p>Nothing can hurt the Church but it ſelf, and it is never in more danger than when it is in its greateſt Pomp and Grandure.</p>
            <p>The deceit of this is very plain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they that bawl moſt of the Danger the Church is in, have the leaſt of Religion in their Lives, for thoſe who live and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand better, ſee the folly of it, as alſo
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:58538:167"/>that Doctrine of <hi>Paſſive Obedience, and Nonreſistance,</hi> which many cry'd up as the Corner Stone of the Church. A Burden which they were forward to lay upon other peoples Shoulders, yet when it came to their own turn, none was ſo uneaſy under it as they; for when their Rights came to be toucht; No mens Mouths was ſo full of Liberty and Property as theirs: But now that the Storm is blown over, they are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry that that Liberty is granted to others, which they promiſed to conſent to, and are returned to where they were, in ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Arbitary Doctrine, and to that end they are inventing new Titles to the Crown for this <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen,</hi> which demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates what Steddy men theſe are, ſince in the late times they would not allow any Title to be good but <hi>Succeſſion;</hi> yet now they can ſubmit to any other, how contrary ſoever to Succeſſion, provided they can there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by keep up this Arbitrary Doctrine and get their turns ſerved; and firſt they find out for this King and Queen, a Title by Conqueſt.</p>
            <p>I hope they are miſtaken; for if the caſe be ſo, we are all Slaves, and inſtead of being rid of Arbitrary Power by this Revolution, we have helpt to Saddle and Bridle our ſelves. For the people that are conquered, hold all they have at the will and pleaſure of him who did ſubdue them.</p>
            <p>But how were we conquer'd? did the <hi>Nation</hi> conquer it ſelf? if it did, it was an odd
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:58538:168"/>thing and altogether new. Or who was conquer'd? not they who actually appear'd in Arms againſt King <hi>James,</hi> nor thoſe who wiſht him ſomewhere elſe, and that was by much the greateſt part of the <hi>Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſo ſenceleſs a Notion that it only ſerves to diſcover the ignorance or knavery of thoſe who go about to maintain it, and I ſuppoſe we ſhall hear no more of it, becauſe the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> in <hi>Parliament</hi> by an unanimous Vote have condemn'd it.</p>
            <p>The Next thing talkt of is Gods ways of diſpoſing of Kingdoms, whence they would pretend that the King and Queen received the Crown from God Almightys imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate donation.</p>
            <p>It is <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> to exclude the power of God in any Caſe; and to exclude the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from having had an immediate hand in beſtowing the Crown, is a new intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſort of <hi>Politick,</hi> for the drift of this Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to make us Slaves; by reaſon, That whatever is the immediate Act of God, and a declaration of his pleaſure; Man has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to do, but to yield an intire obedience and ſubmiſſion to it. So that when a King receives his Crown immediately from God, any Proviſions or Limitations that can be made by Men comes too late to circumſcribe his Power.</p>
            <p>But is this our Caſe; which way did God declare that this Man ſhould Reign over us? Or who foreſaw upon what Head
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:58538:168"/>the <hi>Crown</hi> would be placed, till the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> came to a Reſolution in it; and therefore it will follow, That the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen</hi> received their <hi>Crown</hi> from the Hands of the People upon ſuch Terms as they gave it, and God has not done any thing to exempt them from the Performance of thoſe Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: However there are thoſe who hoped to make their Court to their preſent <hi>Majesties,</hi> by ſtarting and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining thoſe two Notions, <hi>Viz.</hi> of <hi>Conqueſt and God's ways of diſpoſing of Kingdoms,</hi> with what ſucceſs, I leave to every mans ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and only ſay this; <hi>That is will be an happy Age, when Kings are ſo much diſpoſed to the good of their People, that ſuch Flatterers will meet with no Incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement from them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come now to ſpeak of <hi>Swearing</hi> and <hi>Drinking,</hi> and I do believe that the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Prophanation of <hi>God's Name,</hi> was never ſo common as in this Age. That great and dreadful Name, before which we ought to Fear and Tremble, is uſed with more familiarity than the meaneſt thing you can think on. It is a very unfortunate thing, whenever we take the Name of <hi>God</hi> irreverently into our Mouths, altho' it happen when we are under ſome Provocation, yet it Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters cauſe for Humiliation, and a more
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:58538:169"/>narrow Obſervation of our ſelves for the future, but is in no ſort a Juſtification of us. Therefore, to fill their mouths with horrible Oaths when they are cool and in temper, and to ſwear in common Diſcourſe is a dreadful hearing: And really it is come to that paſs, that men don't think they expreſs themſelves well and modiſhly, unleſs they interlard every Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence with an Oath or two, and that which is ſtrangely ridiculous is, that ſome cannot ask another man how he does, without wiſhing his own Damnation.</p>
            <p>How this is to be remedied is the Queſtion; for ſince it could not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented from growing to the height to which it is gotten, it will be ſo much the more difficult to ſuppreſs it; for if in any caſe it can be ſaid, That the number of Offenders is too big for the Law, it muſt be allowed to be ſo in this.</p>
            <p>That Law has provided very well for the Puniſhment of ſuch as offend herein, <hi>per Statute</hi> 21ſt. <hi>Jacob. C.</hi> 20. <hi>They forfeit twelve Pence per Oath.</hi> If this were duly put in Execution, I am perſwaded it would work a great Cure: Theſe Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary Swearers would with more wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs open their Lips, when they found that their Oaths coſt them ſo dear; and I am the rather of this opinion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:58538:169"/>I have obſerved, That when a common Swearer is in the preſence of any perſon, whoſe Authority or Quality has an awe over him, ſcarcely an Oath ſlips from him, tho' he ſpeaks never ſo much.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is very much to be wiſht that Magiſtrates would more ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inform themſeves of ſuch as offend herein, and give them the puniſhment which their Offence deſerves.</p>
            <p>The next thing is the <hi>Sin of Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> which calls aloud for redreſs, it being now ſo common and univerſal, that People of all Ages, Sex, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions are infected with it, to that degree that it is become the Reproach of the <hi>Nation,</hi> which is now as remarkable for this Sin, as it was for the <hi>Excellency of our Government during the Reign of Queen Elizabeth;</hi> And it may be Obſerved, That from the time that this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment began to decay, that this beaſtly Cuſtom took its Riſe, I mean when <hi>Queen Elizabeth's</hi> Eyes were cloſed, for from that time has this Government de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, as if ſhe had been the Life of it, and that when ſhe dyed, it expired with her. For the firſt Statutes now in force for the puniſhing of Drunkenneſs, were made in the reign of <hi>King James the firſt,</hi> and therefore it's more than probable
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:58538:170"/>that till then this Vice was not grown up to a conſiderable Size.</p>
            <p>It is ſtrange that men can't enjoy one another without making their Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to become a Sin, and that when People meet to be Merry, they think they have left their Work unfiniſht, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they transform themſelves into Beaſts, and ſo great a force has it with many, That they chooſe rather to be clothed with Raggs, than to keep from the Spiggot. It has brought many a man to a Morſel of Bread, who was well to live before he fell into that Sottiſh courſe.</p>
            <p>It is not for want of a ſufficient pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, that it is grown to ſo great a height; for <hi>per</hi> 4 <hi>Jacob. C.</hi> 5. <hi>He that is Drunk forfeits five Shillings, or for refuſal, or want of Ability to pay it, to be ſet in the Stocks Six Hours:</hi> And for preventing of ſuch Intemperateneſs, <hi>per</hi> ſame <hi>Statute</hi> it is provided, <hi>That he who remains Tipling and Drinking in any Inn, Victualling-Houſe, or Ale-houſe, ſhall forfeit three Shillings and Four Pence, or be put in the Stocks for four Hours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And by the ſame Statute it is provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>That he who having been Convict of Drunkenneſs, ſhall be again Convict of the like Offence, He ſhall be bound to his good behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How this Law comes to lye aſleep, I
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:58538:170"/>know not, for a Law without Execution is but ſo much Ink and Parchment; and I cannot Imagine wherefore no more are puniſht than there is, conſidering how vaſt a Multitude they are that offend herein, unleſs it be, becauſe the thing is become ſo common, that people don't look upon it as an offence, or elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the infection is ſo general, that men think it unreaſonable to have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther puniſht for that of which he is guilty himſelf.</p>
            <p>But I am ſure there ought to be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, becauſe the Honour of God ſuffers ſo extreamly by it, and upon a Political account, it ought to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed: Becauſe, as whole Families are impoveriſhed and ruined by it, ſo Mens Bodies are infeebled by it, and rendered unfit for Labour, and the Service of the Publick.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inns, Ale-houſes and Victualling-houſes,</hi> are for relief of Way-fairing men, Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and ſuch others as cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſupply themſelves with Meat and Drink, and not for harbouring of lewd and idle people to conſume their time and Mony in Debauchery as is declared <hi>per Stat.</hi> 1. <hi>Jac. C.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>The Gains which are earned by relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch Perſons as the Law allows, are honeſt and juſtifiable but a Curſe muſt follow what is now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ally got by
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:58538:171"/>
               <hi>Inns</hi> and <hi>Ale houſes,</hi> who can ſuffer Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be Drinking in their Houſes till unreaſonable hours in the Night, nay even on Sundays, and that too during the time of <hi>Divine Service</hi> and <hi>Sermon,</hi> and there to be ſpending their Mony when at the ſame time they know that their Families at home are ſtarving for want of it.</p>
            <p>Did <hi>Tipling-houſes</hi> conſider what a Riſque they run, ſurely they would take more Care. For when they receive their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſes to ſell <hi>Ale,</hi> they enter into a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizance with Sureties <hi>To keep good Order in their Houſes, per Statute</hi> 1. <hi>Jac.</hi> 9. <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Innkeeper, Victualler, or Ale-houſe-keeper, forfeits ten Shillings, that ſuffers any to ſit Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling in their Houſes, except Traveliers, or ſuch as have not the Convenience of Eating and Drinking elſewhere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Per Statutes</hi> 7. <hi>Jac.</hi> 10. and 21. <hi>Jac.</hi> 7. It is provided, <hi>That any who ſhall offend againſt the Statutes made againſt Tipling and Drinking, ſhall be diſabled for three Years from Selling of Ale, and beſides a Conviction in any of theſe Caſes, is a Forfeiture of the Recognizance which they enter into when they are Licenſed to ſell Ale.</hi> Such care has the Law taken, but things are at that paſs as if Drunkenneſs were no Offence, or that there is no Law to puniſh it.</p>
            <pb n="505" facs="tcp:58538:171"/>
            <p>I cannot but obſerve to you, how Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence has order'd things for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Ale-ſellers,</hi> almoſt in their own way; For tho' Quartering of <hi>Soldiers</hi> without Satisfaction to the Houſes, is a very Illegal and Arbitrary Practice, yet it may in ſome ſort be juſt as to them, they received thereby that Meaſure which they have Meeted to others.</p>
            <p>Theſe two things, Gentlemen, I do more eſpecially recommend to your Inquiry, becauſe they do ſo immediately concern the Honour of God, and Peace and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the Publick; Beſides them whatever is an Offence againſt the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Peace, falls within your Inquiry, and I believe you ſo well know them already, that I will not looſe your time in repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them: Nor will all that you or any of us can do, ſignify much, till De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery is ſuppreſt, and the Manners of the Nation are reformed; whilſt we bid God Defiance with our Lives and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, we cannot hope for ſucceſs ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in our Fleet or Army, let our Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Conduct be never ſo great; and tho' the ſupplys we gave to carry on the War, were much greater than they are; if we will not take Warning in time, but go on from Sin to Sin, this War by which we hope to ſecure Peace to our ſelves and Poſterity, may prove our ruine, by Spin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:58538:172"/>it out ſo long till the Purſes of the People are ſo Drain'd, and the Nation ſo impoveriſhed, that it will be an equal Choice, whether we have Peace or War, being either Way expoſed to the like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience. There is ſome great let or hindrance lyes in the way of our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or elſe why do we at this day ſtand looking upon one another, like the Sons of <hi>Jacob,</hi> as if we were at our Wits end, not knowing what to think or expect, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the great Deliverances that God has wrought for us; for we have been wonderfully preſerved, but not by our own Wiſdom or Conduct, for we have made no other uſe of thoſe ſeveral Advantages which God has put into our hands, but as if we expected that he would repeat his Miracles to preſerve us: Wherefore he has ſo ſignally appeared on our behalf, no man can determine, yet a Gueſs may be made; for if his Mercies have their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Effect upon us, by turning us from the Evil of our Ways; he will do more and greater things for us: But if we make him no other return for all his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, than that of an unthankful and hardened heart; Then has he ſhewed theſe great Signs amongſt us, that he may be Juſtified when he Judges, and we be condemned out of our own Mouths; which God of his Mercy prevent, and to that end let every Man do his Duty
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:58538:172"/>at all times, and at all Seaſons; and mind the Publick more than his own particular Advantage. Let neither the Frowns nor Favour of Men, tho' never ſo great, draw him aſide, and then we ſhall ſee Peace in our <hi>Iſrael.</hi> I doubt not <hi>Gentlemen</hi> but you will do your Parts, and this is all that I have to trouble you with at this time.</p>

            <head>THE LEGALITY Of the <hi>Convention-Parliament,</hi> Though not called by Writ.</head>
            <p>IT's a new ſort of Doctrine, That where there is a Power to do a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thing, there cannot alſo be to do a leſs. The Lords who are born Counſellors to the King and Kingdom, the Members of the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> were all duely choſe by ſuch as had Right to Elect Members for <hi>Parliament:</hi> The two Houſes meet at the ſame day, and firſt declare the Throne vacant,
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:58538:174"/>and then fill it with this King and Queen, and they thus Elected, theſe Lords ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge to be our Rightful and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Soveraign Lord and Lady; which is the greateſt thing that the two Houſes are capable of doing, and have thereby, according to the Maxims of thoſe very Lords, altered the Government in a moſt Eſſential point of it; and yet, ſay they, <hi>All Subſequents, tho' with the Concurrence and Conſent of this lawful King and Queen, are invallid, unleſs ſupported by the Authority of this or ſome other Parliament, becauſe the laſt was not called by Writ in due form of Law:</hi> So that the Repreſentatives of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Aſſembled without a Writ, can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do one thing, and that the higheſt, to make a King: And by like Reaſon, If when Aſſembled by Writ, can do every thing but the greateſt: But it is againſt all manner of Reaſon and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, to ſuppoſe that the Power that can make a King, cannot do every thing elſe that is neceſſary to ſettle the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. If thoſe Gentlemen had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the true meaning of Writs, and been ſo ingenious as to confeſs it, they would not have made that an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt the Validity of the laſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p>Writs are neceſſary in their proper time, but not ſo neceſſary as to give the
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:58538:174"/>Eſſence to a Parliament; for if there be any weight in this Reaſon, a Writ is as neceſſary as the Conſent of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by their Legal Repreſentatives to Eſtabliſh any thing into a Law. Writs can amount to no more than the Means by which the Parliament is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>It will be granted that the preſent Writ of Summons was Eſtabliſhed by the Government, and not by the King, and it cannot be deny'd, that wherever the power of the Government reſts, it may, if it ſee Cauſe, direct that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments ſhall be convened in any other manner, or by any other means than by Writ.</p>
            <p>For it is not the Writ that makes a man a true Repreſentative, but the Election of thoſe who have right to chooſe for that place; For otherwiſe the <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff,</hi> or other Officer, might have return'd whom he ſaw good, and Elections would be needleſs. But the Law has more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſhewed, that it is the Election that makes the Perſon a Right Member, and ſo conſequently, the Election of the People, is that which gives the Eſſence to a Parliament, becauſe the Law has under greivious pains commanded, That Election ſhall be free. And ſince the
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:58538:175"/>Conſtitution of the Government makes choice of Writs, for the Canvening of the Repreſentative Body of the Nation, why was not the Parliament as duely concerned, and the Acts they paſſed as good, ſince it was impoſſible to be Summoned in due form; and theſe Gentlemen might as well have inſiſted, That a Nation may want a Power to help it ſelf, as to object againſt the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of the laſt Parliament, becauſe called without Writ.</p>
            <p>By the Weight that they lay upon a Writ, they do ſeem to make a Writ more neceſſary to a Parliament than our Allegiance is to the Government, and if that be ſo, that which is only a Circumſtance in the Government, is more to be regarded than what is neceſſary to the Peace of it; But to grant that Abſurdity, What is it that has given the Sanction to theſe new Oaths, that our ſitting and Voting in Parliament has not put us under all the Diſabilities of 30 <hi>Caroli,</hi> for we are certainly within that Statute, if the laſt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had not power to alter thoſe Oaths; and if it had, what elſe they did is as valid; for all, or none of thoſe Acts are good.</p>
            <pb n="513" facs="tcp:58538:175"/>
            <p>If it be deſtructive of the Monarchy, to declare thoſe Laws to be good, it may be alſo ſaid to be alike deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, when the proper and only means to ſupport it is made uſe of: For the Nation had no other way left of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to a Settlement.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Queſtions that you have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to me are of ſuch a nature, that they require a very ſtrict conſideration, becauſe they are of the greateſt moment in our preſent condition; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you have done me a great honour, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand my Thoughts upon them, in regard you might have had your Queries reſolved by perſons much more able than I am: but ſince you deſire my Opinion, I will give it you very faithfully.</p>
            <pb n="542" facs="tcp:58538:177"/>
            <p>As I remember, the firſt thing that you was in doubt of, was, <hi>Whether the Crown of</hi> England <hi>be Hereditary, or no;</hi> and to that I anſwer negatively, <hi>That it is not Hereditary.</hi> And in order to the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of this, I will, in the firſt place, give you a ſhort hiſtorical account of Matter of Fact till K. <hi>James.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think it will not be denied, that from the firſt known Times in this Iſland (after that they had Kings) till the Conqueſt, <hi>but that the People Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted him for their King whom they beſt liked, without regard had to the Iſſue of the deceaſed King:</hi> and alſo, <hi>that they depoſed them very frequently, and ſet up others in their ſtead, when upon tryal they were found unfit for the purpoſe.</hi> He that ſays other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, confeſſes himſelf, either not to have read our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Story, or that he underſtood not what he read: and if your ſelf doubts the truth of what I affirm, I will at any time give you a particular account of it, till the entrance of the <hi>Normans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>William</hi> the Firſt, commonly called the <hi>Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi> we muſt begin with him, who, it's moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, had no Right or Title to the Crown, by <hi>Inheritance</hi> or <hi>Deſcent;</hi> and it is as true that he did not gain it by <hi>Conqueſt:</hi> for <hi>Edgar Etheling,</hi> who was alive and in <hi>England</hi> when <hi>William</hi> came in, had an unqueſtionable right by Deſcent, and therefore whilſt he was alive <hi>William</hi> could not pretend any Title by Inheritance, but muſt find out ſome other way to come to the Crown; and therefore he pretended one while a <hi>Compact</hi> between him and <hi>Harold;</hi> and again, That it was left to him by <hi>Edward the Confeſſor,</hi> by his Will; yet he found that all theſe were but empty ſounds: for although he had a potent Army, by which he
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:58538:177"/>might have done great things, yet that Army on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought him into <hi>England,</hi> but it was <hi>the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the People that gave him the Crown,</hi> and he ſoon perceived, that there was no Reſt for the Sole of his Foot, till he had taken the <hi>Coronation Oath,</hi> and had ſworn to maintain their <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Properties.</hi> Some little Irregularities muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in a time when things are unſettled, but it will ſcarcely be found, that any man was <hi>diſcea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> of his <hi>Freehold,</hi> but only ſuch whoſe <hi>Demerits</hi> render'd them unworthy of them: and from his time the <hi>Norman</hi> Government proceeded upon the <hi>Saxon</hi> Principles; for King <hi>William,</hi> by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his Nobles, cauſed a ſelect number of Men out of every County to be ſummoned, who were to ſet down their <hi>Laws,</hi> what they were in <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Confeſſor</hi>'s time; for it was he who had collected the <hi>Laws,</hi> which at this day is called the <hi>Common Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then, after him, <hi>William</hi> II. and <hi>Hen.</hi> I. ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded each other, and <hi>their Title was by Election of the People;</hi> for <hi>Robert</hi> their elder Brother was alive, and ſaw them both preferred to the Crown, and he never enjoy'd it, for he died a Priſoner at <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diff Caſtle,</hi> in the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> I.</p>
            <p>The next was K. <hi>Stephen,</hi> who was ſecond Son to <hi>Adela</hi> Daughter to <hi>William the Conqueror;</hi> he was choſen by the People, for he had an elder Brother whoſe Name was <hi>Theobald,</hi> and there was <hi>Maud</hi> the Empreſs, Daughter to <hi>Henry</hi> I. and both theſe were nearer by deſcent than he.</p>
            <p>After him came <hi>Hen.</hi> II. he came in by <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact</hi> between K. <hi>Stephen</hi> himſelf, and the Nobles, and the good liking of the People; for <hi>Maud</hi> his Mother was alive, and by <hi>deſcent</hi> it belonged to her.</p>
            <pb n="544" facs="tcp:58538:178"/>
            <p>Then <hi>Richard</hi> I. was elected in his Father's Life-time, and received Homage from the Peers.</p>
            <p>King <hi>John</hi> was choſen by the People, or elſe <hi>Arthur</hi> his elder Brother's Son, who was then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, would have ſucceeded <hi>Richard</hi> I.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> III. came in by <hi>Election,</hi> for <hi>Lewis</hi> the French Prince pretended to the Crown, ſeveral of the Nobility having called him into their aid againſt King <hi>John,</hi> and had ſworn to him: but the Fall of <hi>Pembrook,</hi> who had married <hi>Henry</hi>'s Aunt, ſtuck to him, and got him crowned by the <hi>conſent</hi> of the <hi>Nobles</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> after that he had taken the Coronation Oath, and made other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to the People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward</hi> I. being out of the Land when his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther died, was choſen by the <hi>conſent of the Lords and Commons;</hi> and I find that the Nation was ſworn to the Succeſſion of <hi>Edward</hi> I. before he went to the <hi>Holy Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward</hi> II. being miſ-led by his Favourites, was depoſed, and his Son</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward</hi> III. was declared King in his Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard</hi> II. Son to <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Black Prince,</hi> was depoſed for his <hi>Evil Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> IV. came in by <hi>Election of the People,</hi> and though upon occaſion ſometimes he might pretend to ſeveral other Titles, yet he found them unſtable; and to make ſure, he got the Crown entailed by <hi>Act of Parliament;</hi> and ſo came in</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> V. and then his Son</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> VI. but he being found unmeet for Government, enclining too much to the Counſels of his Wife, (who was a <hi>Foreigner</hi>) and negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the Advices of his Parliament, he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and</p>
            <pb n="545" facs="tcp:58538:178"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward</hi> IV. who was E. of <hi>March,</hi> whoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the D. of <hi>York,</hi> by Act of Parliament, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Heir apparent to the Crown, and afterwards ſlain in the Battel at <hi>Wakefield.</hi> He, I ſay, was <hi>Elected,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Henry</hi> was reſtored, and <hi>Edward</hi> ſet aſide; but at laſt <hi>Edward</hi> was ſetled, and dies, and the Crown came to his Son.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward</hi> V. who lived no longer than to be put into the Catalogue of our <hi>Engliſh Kings,</hi> and then</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard</hi> III. was confirmed King by Act of Parliament: for <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Daughter to <hi>Edw.</hi> IV. was living, who afterwards was married to <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> VII. and by right of deſcent the Crown belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to her, and he had no Title but what the People gave him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> VII. came in by <hi>Election;</hi> for his Wives Title preceded his: and there was alſo <hi>Edward Plantaginet,</hi> Son to <hi>George</hi> D. of <hi>Clarence,</hi> had an unqueſtionable Right before him, if <hi>Deſcent</hi> might take place; but to clear all doubts, he got the Crown ſetled by Act of Parliament upon him and the Heirs of his Body ſucceſſively for ever; and upon that came in</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. and in his time the Crown was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited three ſeveral times by Act of Parliament, and there ſucceeded upon thoſe limitations, firſt,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward</hi> VI. then his Siſter</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> by <hi>Katherine</hi> Widow to Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> and then</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> by <hi>Ann</hi> Daughter to Sir <hi>Thomas Bullen;</hi> and in the thirteenth year of her Reign a Law was made, <hi>whereby it is made penal, if any ſay that the</hi> Parliament <hi>cannot limit the Succeſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="546" facs="tcp:58538:179"/>
            <p>And now, Sir, I have given you a juſt account how the Crown has been diſpoſed; and if I ſhould ſay no more, I think that this of it ſelf might convince any impartial man, that the Crown, till King <hi>James,</hi> was in the Peoples diſpoſe.</p>
            <p>But that I may leave no place for doubt, I will ſay ſomething to thoſe things which are ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently objected, and I will begin with that which ſays, as follows; <hi>Although there be many Inſtances where the Crown has leaped over the right Heir by deſcent, and has lit upon the Head of another, yet, ſay they, there are ſeveral Inſtances, both before the Conqueſt and ſince, where the Son has ſucceeded to the Father, and that theſe are chiefly to be regarded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe moſt agreeable to the Word of God,</hi> which tells us, That <hi>by me Kings reign,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents that are otherwiſe, are no better than Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not to be eſteemed as legal, but to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten as Errors in the Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I acknowledge, there is ſuch a Text of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, but I muſt deny, that it is to be taken in the literal ſence, for otherwiſe the King muſt be look'd upon to receive his Soveraign Power im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from God, without any regard had to our <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Conſtitutions,</hi> and then he is King <hi>Jure divino,</hi> and no Bounds or Limits of Humane Contrivance can be ſet to his Will, but we are wholly at his Mercy and Pleaſure, and <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and the <hi>Petition of Right</hi> are waſte Paper: nay, it not only deſtroys our <hi>Government,</hi> but it puts an end to all other Conſtitutions in the World: But the true meaning of the Words are, <hi>That Kings are to be obeyed, and that they are to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern under God, according to the Laws of that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:58538:179"/>and that they are to adminiſter the Laws and Juſtice according to the Rules and Directions of that Conſtitution, and not that Kings hereby ſhall have a Warrant to be unjuſt, or govern arbitrarily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But becauſe there are ſome Inſtances where the <hi>Son</hi> has ſucceeded to the <hi>Father,</hi> that therefore the Crown comes by <hi>deſcent,</hi> I cannot grant; for this Iſland has ſeldom been free from War, and then the People are not at leiſure to regard every Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of their Right, but are willing to have it at an end upon any terms, and are not then ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardful under whom they enjoy their Liberties and Properties, as that they may have them: And hence it might come to paſs, that the <hi>Son</hi> ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the <hi>Father,</hi> as it befel in the caſe of <hi>Henry</hi> III. his Father K. <hi>John</hi> had been quarreling with his <hi>Barons,</hi> and they called in <hi>Lewis</hi> the F. Prince to their aid, and ſeveral ſwore to him; but K. <hi>John</hi> dying, and the Nation being willing to be at reſt, they choſe rather to have <hi>Henry</hi> III. being a Child, whom they had hopes to train up in the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of an Engliſh King, than to admit <hi>Lewis,</hi> who was a Foreigner. Or elſe, that out of Gratitude to the memory of their deceaſed King, who had done good things for the Nation, they choſe his Son, believing him to inherit his <hi>Father's Vertues,</hi> and therefore deſerved the Crown better than any other perſon: as it befel in the caſe of <hi>Edw.</hi> II. and <hi>Rich.</hi> II. and <hi>Hen.</hi> VI. who all deceiv'd them, and therefore were depoſed. I think the reſt of the Inſtances where the Son has followed his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the Throne, are, where the Succeſſion was continued to them by Act of Parliament, or by Election, in the life-time of the Father; as it happen'd in the caſe of <hi>Rich.</hi> I. and <hi>Edw.</hi> I.</p>
            <pb n="548" facs="tcp:58538:180"/>
            <p>But I think it is without all diſpute a known Cuſtom in <hi>England,</hi> that <hi>where a man has any Eſtate either real or perſonal, if it came to him by Deſcent, although he has no further power of it, yet during his Life he may diſpoſe of it as to him ſhall ſeem meet, and diveſt himſelf of it to all intents and purpoſes:</hi> And therefore if the Crown of <hi>England</hi> comes by deſcent, what hinders that he who enjoys it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not alien or diſpoſe of it during his own life? for whenever it has been attempted, the People has ſtill oppoſed it: as in the caſe of K. <hi>John,</hi> when he laid down the Crown at the Feet of <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulphus</hi> the Pope's Legate, and he kept it three days for the Pope's uſe; this being done without the Conſent of the Nation, the King was told, <hi>He could not make any conveyance of it without the leave of the People:</hi> and although he had the Pope for his Second, who was obliged to ſtand by him in maintaining what he had done, not only out of the advantage he would gain hereby againſt King <hi>John</hi> and his Succeſſors, but alſo to encourage his other Sons to the like Dutifulneſs and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; yet the <hi>People</hi> were Victors, and the King fairly gave up the Cudgels: Which methinks clears the Point very well, for our Lawyers tell us, <hi>That a Preſident where the thing has been diſputed, is worth a thouſand where there was no Conteſt.</hi> I will give you another Inſtance, though not the very ſame, yet I think not impertinent to be mentioned. Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> upon her firſt enjoyment of her Husband <hi>Philip,</hi> was very fond of him, and thinking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be too good for him, ſhe had a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to have him <hi>crowned,</hi> but notwithſtanding her Importunities, the Parliament would not conſent, and ſhe never had her Deſire: Whereas if the
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:58538:180"/>
               <hi>Crown</hi> had come to her by <hi>deſcent,</hi> ſhe need not have asked the <hi>Parliament</hi> leave, nor had K. <hi>John</hi> been to blame, to give away that which was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely his own.</p>
            <p>It is true, that in the life-time of <hi>H.</hi> II. his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Son was crowned, but he firſt acquainted his Lords with his purpoſe, which implies, that he asked their conſent, which is very probable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſwore Allegiance to him; which they would never have done, had it not been with their good liking, for the Lords were more ſturdy in thoſe days than they are in ours, for they would yield no further than they ſaw there was <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>I have heard it objected, <hi>That the three Children of</hi> Hen. VIII. <hi>ſucceeded to the Crown by his Will;</hi> it may be ſo, and yet not clear the point, <hi>That the Crown comes by Inheritance;</hi> for <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. had ſhaken off the Pope's Authority, and the People might be very willing to accept his Son <hi>Edward</hi> for their King; and it had been a wonder if they had refuſed him, ſeeing he was a Proteſtant, and one like to perfect the Reformation: But in his Succeſſor Q. <hi>Mary</hi> we find the Preſident of <hi>bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the Crown by Will</hi> overthrown; for <hi>Edw.</hi> VI. by his laſt Will had given the Crown to <hi>Jane Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,</hi> and to make the thing more valid, he cauſed the Nobility, Biſhops, and Judges to ſet their Hands to it, and yet Q. <hi>Mary</hi> prevailed againſt this Will: but <hi>Arthur</hi> Son to <hi>Jeoffery,</hi> who was Brother to <hi>Rich.</hi> I. and K. <hi>John,</hi> was not only Son to the elder Brother, but was deſigned by <hi>Rich.</hi> I. to be his <hi>Succeſſor</hi> to the <hi>Crown:</hi> So that if any thing would have prevailed againſt the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the People,</hi> without doubt <hi>Arthur</hi> would
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:58538:181"/>have had the <hi>Crown,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> muſt have waited longer.</p>
            <p>But if the Crown of <hi>England</hi> comes by <hi>Deſcent</hi> or <hi>Inheritance,</hi> I deſire to ask by what Title all the Kings and Queens ſince the <hi>Conqueſt</hi> have poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Throne; for no man can have the face to ſay, that the firſt <hi>William</hi> came in by <hi>Deſcent,</hi> but that his Title was either by <hi>Election, Conqueſt,</hi> or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation,</hi> and all that have ſucceeded him out of his Loins are upon the ſame bottom with him; and if his Title was not by <hi>Election,</hi> then he and all his Succeſſors can be termed nothing but <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,</hi> who came in by force, and have maintained it by might againſt <hi>Law:</hi> for it is very well known, <hi>that a Poſſeſſion which is illegal at firſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be better by continuing it; nor does it mend the matter, if they hold it never ſo long, the Right re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains the ſame.</hi> And therefore having ſaid this, I do preſume it will be as difficult to underſtand thoſe things mentioned in the 30th Chapter of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> Verſe the 19th. as it is to prove that the Crown of <hi>England</hi> comes by <hi>Deſcent.</hi> But poſſibly, when there ſhall be a Man ſo much wiſer than <hi>Solomon,</hi> that can unriddle thoſe four things, he may be able to clear this firſt, and reſolve all other Doubts that may be propoſed to him: but till that be, I hope the People will hold their Right in diſpoſing of the Crown, and not be bound to admit the next of Blood, if he be not fit for it.</p>
            <p>I will now, Sir, proceed to your ſecond De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Whether the Duke ought to be excluded;</hi> and to that I do anſwer affirmatively, That <hi>he ought to be ſet aſide;</hi> for if he had not deſerved it very
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:58538:181"/>juſtly, the late Houſe of Commons would not have been ſo vigorous and intent upon the Bill, neither would the preceding mercinary Houſe of Commons have ſaid a word againſt him, if his Faults had not been very plain: but the whole thing is ſo evident, that there needs nothing more to enforce the Reaſons for his excluſion; for, <hi>Is it a ſmall thing to hold a Correſpondence with the Pope and the French King, the two great Enemies to our Religion and Government? to procure Pardons for</hi> Papiſts, <hi>and keeping none about him but</hi> Papiſts, <hi>or Popiſhly affected? to prevail with the King to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ, prorogue and diſſolve Parliaments when they were doing thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> of the greateſt moment for the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and on purpoſe to defeat thoſe very matters they had in hand?</hi> If he will adventure to do theſe things whilſt he is a Subject, what may we not juſtly expect from him if he happen to be King?</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding all this, ſome will ſay, That <hi>the Word of God will not allow us to put by the next Heir to the Crown, be he what he will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by</hi> Moſes<hi>'s Law the next of Blood muſt inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi> Truly I am for that too when we are in a good Breed, but as our Caſe ſtands I cannot yield to it. But, under favour, I conceive, that this Text alſo obliges no otherwiſe than according to the conſtitution of every Government: for if the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Law be our Direction, then the Duke will be King of a third part of theſe Dominions before his Brother is dead, for by that Law <hi>the Eldeſt was only to have a double Portion, and no more;</hi> and then, I pray, what Abſurdities will follow upon this Doctrine? But it is moſt plain, that this Law related only to private Families, and had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the ſetting up or pulling down of Kings,
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:58538:182"/>for when the Law was given, the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had no King, nor any proſpect of it, and it was ſeveral Ages after that before they petitioned God for a King, and <hi>Saul</hi> was the firſt; and the Practice after <hi>Saul</hi> puts the Matter out of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie; for when <hi>Saul</hi> was dead, <hi>David</hi> was anointed, though there remained ſeveral of the Seed of <hi>Saul:</hi> After <hi>David, Solomon</hi> was anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, tho' <hi>Adonijah</hi> was his elder Brother, and his Mother the honeſter Woman of the two: When <hi>Solomon</hi> was dead, <hi>Jeroboam</hi> rent away ten Tribes from <hi>Rehoboam;</hi> and ſo on. But theſe Inſtances are ſufficient to prove, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did not believe that they were obliged to chuſe him for their King that was next of Blood: And if they might do this, who had the preſence of God amongſt them, and his immediate Direction, more than any other People, certainly then we cannot be ſaid to ſin againſt the Light: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, in all private Families there is care taken to preſerve the continuance of them, by diſinheriting the eldeſt Son, when it is perceived that he will ruine the Eſtate, if he be ever poſſeſſed of it: but to this ſome will anſwer, That <hi>it is ſeldom ſeen that ever any Family proſpered long where the right Heir was ſet aſide:</hi> I think ſo too, when the right Heir is deprived of his Birthright, for no juſt cauſe; but we find that ſeveral Families have continued many Generations after that the right Heir has been rejected; and yet tho' an ill Fate ſhould always attend that Family where this is done, yet is it not better to continue it two or three Succeſſions longer, tho' with a certainty of Ruine at laſt, rather than ſuffer it to come into
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:58538:182"/>the Hands of him, who will in a few years, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps months, bring it to nothing.</p>
            <p>You cannot but have heard of <hi>Maud</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, who was Daughter to <hi>Henry</hi> I. what Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Bloodſhed ſhe cauſed in <hi>England,</hi> in the days of K. <hi>Stephen,</hi> and this is often inſiſted on to ſhew <hi>what evil Conſequences there will follow upon ſecluding the Duke.</hi> It is true, ſhe made a great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, but ſhe had that to pretend which the Duke has not, for the Nation had taken an Oath to her in the life-time of her Father, and from that ſhe might preſume very much, but the Conditions were not performed upon which the Oath was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and therefore the Obligation was void, and the People were at liberty to chuſe whom they pleaſed. But beſides, whether the Duke get the Crown or no, much Blood muſt be ſpilt, for we muſt either fight or burn; and whether it be not better to exclude the Duke by a Law, and adventure our Lives in defence of that and all our Laws and Religion into the bargain, than to let him come to the Crown, and at beſt hand hang up Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of worthy Men, if he do not extirpate their Name and Families: but to be ſure all thoſe who gave their Votes to the Bill, nay, all that have declared their Approbation of it, and all their Friends and Relations, are deſtin'd by him and the Pope for Deſtruction, if not all them who voted to elect them Members of Parliament: And how far this will extend, let any man conſider.</p>
            <p>Sir, I am now come to your laſt Doubt, which is, <hi>How far we ought to obey the Duke if he happen to be King, and there be no Law, I mean, no Act of Parliament to exclude him.</hi> This is truly a tender
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:58538:183"/>place, and ought to be handled only in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Houſe; but becauſe I dare truſt you in this captious Age, I will lay before you ſome things that I think cannot be denied. It is a known Maxim in our Law, That <hi>protectio trahit ſubjectionem, &amp; ſubjectio trahit protectionem.</hi> Theſe are plain words, and are of as clear a ſenſe, that is not equivocal or capable of a double conſtruction; and I take them to be the mutual Bonds between a King and his People, and one introduces the other, and they cannot be ſeparated; for if Protection draws after it Subjection, and Obedience incites Protection, then whether or no can there be Protection where there is no Subjection, or can there be Obedience where there is no Protection? and then if it be not done on the one part, how can it be required from the other? for if the King ſhall go about to deſtroy the Government, or take away our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, does he not diſown us, and deny us his Protection? and then, I pray, what Obedience is due to him that regards us not? Or, if the Subjects ſhall not obey the King's Writs, or other Commands, which by Law he may require from them, do not they diſown him, and forbid him to concern himſelf with them? and then, I pray, what has he to do, but to do to them as they have done to him? And this will be the caſe, ſhould the Duke, being a Papiſt, come to the Crown. We ſee already that his Inclinations are for our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and beſides, his Religion obliges him to it, and therefore what Protection can we hope to have from him whoſe Conſcience and Deſire are united for our Ruine? for it is not in the power of a Popiſh King to preſerve us, for if he will protect us, and the Pope command our Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:58538:183"/>he muſt either violate his own Conſcience, or give us up to Ruine: So dangerous a thing it is to depend upon the Conſcience of a Papiſt, who cannot be tyed or obliged by any Oaths or Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations; and it is ſafer to have a Proteſtant King, tho' he has no Morality, rather than to live under a Popiſh King, tho' he be the beſt Man living. Altho' I have heard many ſay, <hi>How came it to paſs that we retain'd our Properties, conſidering that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery was ſo long profeſſed in this Nation?</hi> To that a ſhort Anſwer will ſerve, That the Pope's Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was never eſtabliſh'd here by Law, altho' he was allowed many things by reaſon of the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition and Blindneſs that then overſpread this Iſland, yet the King and Parliament could never agree to give him any power by Law; nay, when he grew immodeſt in his Encroachments upon the Church, they made Laws to reſtrain him, but the Truth is, it was the Reſolution of the Parliament, and eſpecially of the Lords, that protected the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the Pope; but if Popery ſhould now come in, we ſhould have it to all intents and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, for it would poſſeſs both Church and State, it muſt have all. Q. <hi>Marys</hi> days are a ſufficient Warning what we muſt expect from a <hi>Popiſh Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor,</hi> and how far their Promiſes are to be relyed on, for by the aſſiſtance of the Men of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi> it was that ſhe did her buſineſs; and what Promiſes did ſhe make to them, not to make any alteration in Religion, and ſaid many other fine things, yet as ſoon as ſhe was ſetled on the Throne the firſt thing ſhe did, was to alter Religion with the greateſt violence and effuſion of Blood that was poſſible, and theſe Men of <hi>Suffolk</hi> and <hi>Norfolk</hi> felt
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:58538:184"/>the firſt ſtroke of her Hand, and perhaps the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt heat of her Fury.</p>
            <p>But I have too far digreſſed from my firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, which is, <hi>That if Protection from the King is not given to his Subjects, or Obedience in the Subjects is not paid to the King, then if one ſide fail, the other is diſcharged, and the Condition being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, the Obligation is void.</hi> And this was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why <hi>Vortigern</hi> the <hi>Saxon</hi> King was depoſed by his Lords, for he was grown too friendly to <hi>Heu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſt</hi> the <hi>Dane,</hi> and the Lords perceiving that he intended to betray the Land to him, they, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Common Deſtruction, and becauſe by this practice he had abſolved them of their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, therefore they depoſed him, and ſet up his Son <hi>Vortimer,</hi> becauſe he was a true lover of his Country. There are ſeveral other Inſtances of the like nature, which would be needleſs to be cited, becauſe I ſhould rather amuſe than ſatisfie you of the Truth, ſhould I recount them all.</p>
            <p>In the next place I do conceive, that <hi>the King, until he be Crowned, is not ſo much King to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and purpoſes, as he is after he is Crowned;</hi> for if the crowning of the King be but a meer Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony or Compliment of State, and not eſſential in giving him a Right to the Allegiance of the Subject, then certainly no King of <hi>England</hi> would be troubled with the Ceremony of being formally crowned, becauſe then there will lye no Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon him to take the Coronation Oath, and ſo he may be more at liberty to act according to his Will, becauſe his Conſcience will not be clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the weight of ſo ſolemn an Oath; and then with leſs Infamy and Reflection he may
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:58538:184"/>ſuſpend or pervert the Laws; and therefore with ſubmiſſion to better Judgments, I am not convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that the King, whilſt he is uncrowned, has that Right in our Allegiance as he has after that the Crown is ſet upon his Head, in the ſame way that it ought to be done, for before the Crown is ſet upon his Head by the Archbiſhop, or other perſon appointed to do it, the Nobility and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are asked, <hi>if they will do their Homage and Service to him;</hi> which by the way implies, that the People are at liberty in the thing, and that if he be Crowned, it is by their Leave and Election; then if the People conſent, the King takes the Coronation Oath, which is, <hi>to preſerve the Church, our Laws, Liberties, and Properties, and to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Juſtice indifferently;</hi> and thus, when he has Sworn to us, the Crown is immediately put upon his Head, and then the Nobility and People do their Homage to him: and according to this has been the Practice ever ſince there were Kings in <hi>England.</hi> And I believe there is ſcarcely an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance <hi>where the People ever ſwore to the King before be had taken his Oath to them:</hi> If there be any ſuch Preſident, it is to be look'd upon as irregular, and not to be a Direction to us; for it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but ſuch a thing may happen, but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, is it reaſonable that one or two Inſtances ſhall be ſufficient to invalid a Practice of ſeveral hundred years to the contrary? And is it not a piece of nonſence, that we ſhould adventure our Religion, and Properties, and all we have, in the Hand of him, that for ought we know has an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation on him to ruine or give us up to a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner, and not in the firſt place to take Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from him, that he will defend and do us right,
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:58538:185"/>before we repoſe ſo great a Truſt in him, for otherwiſe ſuch Confuſion and ſuch Contradictions would follow, that the Wit of Man cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent how to ſalve them.</p>
            <p>But I acknowledge there are ſome Inſtances <hi>where the People have ſworn to the Succeſſion in the life-time of the Father; and thence ſome do inferr, that the King is entitled to our Allegiance before the Crown is ſet on his Head:</hi> but this, under corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction will not hold, for it does not appear, but that the intended Succeſſor ſwore to them alſo at the ſame time; and it is very probable he did: yet if he did not, it cannot thence be concluded, that the King has Right to our Allegiance before he is Crowned; for whenever it happen'd that the Succeſſor was ſworn to in the life-time of his Father, if afterwards he came to the Crown, he took the Coronation Oath before the People ſwore Allegiance to him: And therefore it is very plain, that an Oath taken to the Succeſſor in the life-time of his Father, is nothing more but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the good liking they have of the Succeſſor, and that if in caſe he will promiſe to defend them and their Properties, when his Father or Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor dies, they will elect him for their King; as poſſibly it might now fall out, if in caſe the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> were legitimate: Don't you think that the People would be very inclinable to ſwear to his Succeſſion next after the King? And I believe you will never find it done, but when the King had the Hearts of the People, or out of the hopes they had in the Succeſſor, for Engliſh Men, if the King pleaſes them, he may have all they have, even to their Skins; as a wiſe man ſaid, <hi>If an</hi> Engliſh <hi>King will be kind to the People,
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:58538:185"/>he can never want their Heads, Hands, and Purſes:</hi> and therefore it is, that in the moſt peaceable and tranquil times that ever the Land ſaw, when King and People had a mutual Confidence of each other, we find things done by the King that are more irregular in thoſe times of agreement, than was done in times of greater confuſion; and the reaſon is, becauſe the King ſtrove to pleaſe the People, and they were willing to gratifie him by conniving at his Faults.</p>
            <p>But beſides all this, the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> is to be conſidered, and this Law cannot be extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by any other Laws whatſoever: And this I never heard any man deny. <hi>The Law of Nature commands Self-preſervation;</hi> and then I would ask, <hi>whether I am to obey him that will deſtroy me.</hi> If we ſhall have a Prince that plainly declares either by his Words or Actions, that he will change our Government and Religion, or that he will give us up to a Foreigner, or elſe that he will govern by a ſtanding Army, and take away our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, muſt I obey him? muſt I not endeavour to reſcue my Self and Country from Ruine? for in the <hi>Saxons</hi> time, <hi>Treaſon did not relate to any thing but the Government, and the general Concern of the Nation, and not to the ſingle Perſon of the King:</hi> and now, though it be Treaſon to kill the King, yet it is only in order to the Publick Good; and therefore with the <hi>Saxons</hi> all Indictments againſt <hi>Legience</hi> concluded <hi>Feloniae &amp; Proditoriae,</hi> but againſt the Perſon of the King only <hi>Feloniae:</hi> But in our days we find things are crept in that is difficult to tell how or when they came in. And you ſhall find in all our ancient Laws, <hi>that whatever
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:58538:186"/>was decreed or enacted was for the Common Good, and the King was not concerned otherwiſe, than ſo far as related to the Common-wealth;</hi> though I know, in our days, another Opinion is aſſerted, which I am ſure cannot be maintained, <hi>That all things muſt give place to the King's particular Intereſt.</hi> For my own part, I will obey the King, but I think my <hi>Obedience</hi> is obliged no further than what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands is for the <hi>Common Good.</hi> Our <hi>Government</hi> ever ſince the <hi>Conqueſt</hi> has proceeded upon the <hi>Saxon</hi> Principles, and they were grounded upon Self-preſervation, which I do not find to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated by any Act of Parliament; for all our Lawyers do agree, <hi>That it is Treaſon to ſubvert the Government:</hi> and if ſo, without doubt our <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance,</hi> the <hi>Laws of God and of Nature</hi> command us <hi>to defend</hi> them.</p>
            <p>I will detain you no longer, but only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this one thing: Whenever we have a <hi>Popiſh King,</hi> we muſt expect an alteration at leaſt in our Religion; for though he take all the Oaths and Declarations that can be deviſed, yet it ever ſtands in the way to oppoſe the Intereſt of <hi>Rome, they muſt all give place,</hi> and it is meritorious to break thoſe Engagements for that purpoſe, or, at worſt hand, be certainly pardoned, if he preſume to do it without a Diſpenſation; and it is no more in his power to preſerve our Religion, than it is for him to work an Impoſſibility. And therefore, whether it is better to oppoſe a <hi>Popiſh Succeſſor,</hi> ſeeing we have the practice of our <hi>Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers</hi> to juſtifie us in it, and beſides, he cannot if he would defend us; or elſe to ſuffer him to reſt in the Throne, to deſtroy all we have, and
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:58538:186"/>bring in a Religion <hi>that will damn Millions of Souls from Generation to Generation:</hi> And if we may not defend our Religion, then we muſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely depend upon <hi>Providence</hi> in every thing, and not put out our Hand to help our ſelves up when we are <hi>fallen into a Ditch.</hi> This is the Caſe, and here is an end of all Human Policy, but without doubt it is our <hi>Duty</hi> to do our <hi>Endeavours,</hi> and leave the Succeſs to <hi>God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and his Will be done.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF WILLIAM EARL Of <hi>Devonſhire.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>ON <hi>Sunday</hi> the 24th. of <hi>April,</hi> 1687. the ſaid Earl meeting on Collonel <hi>Culpepper</hi> in the Drawing Room in <hi>White-hall,</hi> who had formerly affronted the ſaid Earl in the ſaid King's Palace, for which he had not received any ſatisfaction, he ſpake to the ſaid Collonel to go with him into the next Room, who went with him accordingly; and when they were there, the ſaid Earl required of him to go down Stairs, that he might have Satisfaction for the Affront done him, as aforeſaid; which the Collonel refuſing to do, the ſaid Earl ſtruck him with his Stick, as is ſuppos'd. This being made known to the King, the ſaid Earl was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the-Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Wright,</hi> by
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:58538:188"/>Warrant to appear before him with Sureties: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly <hi>April</hi> 27. he did appear, and gave Bail in 30000 <hi>l.</hi> to appear the next day at the <hi>King's Bench,</hi> himſelf in 10000 <hi>l.</hi> and his four Suretles in 5000 <hi>l.</hi> a piece, who were the Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> Lord <hi>Clifford</hi> the Earl of <hi>Burlington</hi>'s Son, Lord <hi>De-la-mere,</hi> and <hi>Tho. Wharton,</hi> Eſq eldeſt Son to Lord <hi>Wharton.</hi> The Earl appeared accordingly next morning, and then the Court told him, <hi>that his Appearance was recorded,</hi> and ſo he had Leave to de part for that time; but upon the ſixth of <hi>May</hi> he appear'd there again, and being then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd to plead to an <hi>Information of Miſdemeanour for ſtriking the ſaid Collonel in the King's Palace,</hi> he inſiſted upon his Priviledge, <hi>That as he was a Peer of</hi> England, <hi>he could not be tryed for any Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanour during the Priviledge of Parliament:</hi> and it being then within time of Priviledge, he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to plead; the Court took time to conſider of it till <hi>Monday,</hi> which was the laſt day of the Term, and the Earl then appeared, and delivered in his former Plea in Parchment; the Judgment given by the Houſe of Lords, in the Caſe of the Earl of <hi>Arundale,</hi> 3 <hi>Car.</hi> was urged on the behalf of the Earl, <hi>viz. That no Lord of Parliament, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then ſitting, or within the uſual times of privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Parliament, is to be impriſon'd or reſtrain'd without ſentence or order of the Houſe, unleſs it be for Treaſon or Felony, or for refuſing to give Surety for the Peace:</hi> And alſo, that the like Priviledge was, about two years before, allow'd in the Caſe of my Lord <hi>Lovelace.</hi> The Court over-rul'd the Earl's Plea, and requir'd him to plead to the Information the firſt day of the next Term, and to be a Plea as of this Term; and ſo he had Leave to depart,
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:58538:188"/>but his Sureties were not called, for to ſee if they would continue as his Bail. The next Term he appeared, and pleaded guilty to the Information, and ſo the laſt day of the Term the Court did award, <hi>That he ſhould pay a Fine of</hi> 30000 l. <hi>be committed to the</hi> King's Bench <hi>till it be paid, and to find Sureties for the Peace for a year.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To all which Proceeding and Judgment three notorious Errors may be aſſign'd.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. <hi>The over-ruling of the Earl's plea of Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>II. <hi>The Exceſſiveneſs of the Fine.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>III. <hi>The Commitment till it be paid.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. The over-ruling the Earl's plea of Priviledge is a thing of that vaſt <hi>conſequence,</hi> that it requires a great deal of time to comprehend it aright, and is of ſo great an extent, that more may be ſaid of it than any one man can ſay. The Judgment ſeems to be very unnatural, becauſe an inferiour Court has taken upon it to reverſe a Judgment given in a ſuperiour, of which no ſuch Preſident is to be found in regular times, ſcarcely in the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed and diſorderly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe it is in Caſe of <hi>Priviledge,</hi> which is the moſt tender part of <hi>every Court;</hi> for if the <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Priviledges</hi> of any Court are made light of, the Court itſelf will ſoon come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, becauſe they are as it were the moſt effen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part of it, if not the very Eſſence of the Court, for what ſignifies a Court, if its Orders cannot be executed? It is better that a Court were not, than that its Priviledges ſhould not be duly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, for without that it becomes a Snare and
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:58538:189"/>Miſchief to the People, rather than an Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe by this <hi>they have ſet the Feet above the Head;</hi> for as they have by this declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be <hi>ſuperior to the Lords,</hi> ſo it will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally follow, that a <hi>Quarter-ſeſſions may reverſe their Orders, or ſuſpend their Priviledges,</hi> and a more <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Court</hi> ſhall ſuperſede what the <hi>Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions</hi> does: And thus it muſt go on till the courſe of <hi>Nature</hi> is <hi>inverted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Becauſe they may as well deny a Lord, or over-rule any other Priviledge, as well as this, and ſo conſequently, when the Houſe of Lords is not actually ſitting, every <hi>Peer</hi> muſt be <hi>beholden to the Judges for every Priviledge that he enjoys.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. If this Judgment be according to <hi>Law,</hi> then may the <hi>King's Bench</hi> try a Peer for <hi>Miſdemeanor,</hi> at the very time when the Houſe of Lords is ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; and conſequently the Houſe muſt want a <hi>Member,</hi> if the <hi>King's Bench</hi> ſees it good to have it ſo; and what a confuſion would it make, and the conſequence of it would be, is eaſily diſcern'd; the want of one Member makes that Houſe think itſelf to be lame: as was ſeen in the Caſe of the Earl of <hi>Arundale,</hi> 3 <hi>Car.</hi> How many Petitions did the Lords make, and how many Meſſages paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to and fro, between the King and them, who would not proceed to any buſineſs <hi>till he was reſtored to his place in that Houſe?</hi> for they told the King, <hi>That no Lord of Parliament, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſitting, or within the uſual times of priviledge of Parliament, is to be impriſon'd or reſtrain'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sentence or Order of the Houſe, unleſs it be for Treaſon or Felony, or for refuſing to give Security for the Peace.</hi> Surely the Judges did not give that
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:58538:189"/>Judgment for want of <hi>underſtanding</hi> that Judgment of the Lords; for nothing can be more expreſs and plain for it: and ſays directly, <hi>That ſitting the Parliament, or within uſual times of priviledge, no Peer ſhall be moleſted, unleſs for Treaſon or Felony, or for refuſing to give Security for the Peace.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Devonſhire</hi> did all that the Judges could require of him, by finding Sureties for the Peace; and what the Judges did more, was not grounded upon that <hi>Judgment of the Lords,</hi> but was a <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt and preſumptuous invaſion and violation of the Priviledges of the whole Peerage of</hi> England.</p>
            <p>It is very obvious how the Peerage has been undermined ever ſince <hi>Hen.</hi> VII's time, what En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours have been uſed to make it leſs and leſs, firſt, by multiplying the number of them; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by raiſing people of mean extraction to that Dignity, both which tend to render it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible; but nothing can make it more deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, than that its Priviledges ſhould depend upon the beck of the <hi>King's Bench:</hi> and therefore conſidering how groundleſs and without preſident it is, what they have done in the Caſe of the ſaid Earl, it is no more than probable, that they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by aimed at pulling down the Peerage. For, what ſeems ſo likely as it does? It carrics its Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in its Face, for it manifeſtly takes away the priviledge of the <hi>Peers,</hi> and till it does appear for what other end it was done, all Men of Sence, and that are unprejudic'd, <hi>muſt believe it was to pull down the Peerage;</hi> for all that can be pretended, is, either to ſecure the <hi>Peace,</hi> or to <hi>puniſh the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</hi> The Earl did give Security for the <hi>Peace,</hi> and he did not deſign to ſhift off his <hi>Tryal,</hi> but that it ſhould be in its proper ſeaſon; for tho' it
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:58538:190"/>delay'd the Trial, yet it brought it to the proper time, and ſo conſequently the more legal and reaſonable: but the Judges muſt go out of the way of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and the <hi>Law,</hi> to make a <hi>breach in the priviledge of the Peers.</hi> It is too commonly the Diſcourſe every where, and I fear with too much reaſon, That <hi>the Judges make very bold with the Law;</hi> but it's plain by this Judgment, <hi>that they have ſtuck the priviledges of the Peers under their Girdle.</hi> Whether it did proceed from <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Corruptneſs,</hi> will appear upon what they ſhall ſay for themſelves: it's too plain from one of them it is, and either of yours renders them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet to ſit in that place. I do remember, that the <hi>puny Judge</hi> gave this Reaſon for over-ruling the Earl's Priviledge: ſays he, <hi>Your Lordſhip, and all the Peers, receive all your Priviledges from the King, and therefore it would be very unreaſonable to make uſe of them againſt him: and ſeeing the King is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this Caſe, I am of the opinion, that their Plea be over-ruled.</hi> It is ſaid, that he has ſome Law, and therefore it's the greater preſumption in him to judge upon the Lords Priviledges, who is not qualified by Law to ſit as a Judge in any Caſe, for he is a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> as every body ſays, and ſo conſequently has not taken the <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Teſt</hi> that the <hi>Law</hi> enjoins, before he take his place on the Bench.</p>
            <p>But as to his Doctrine which he laid down, ſince it does not properly come into this Debate, I will only ask him a few Queſtions, <hi>Whether there was not a People before there was a King? Whether the King begot all his People; and if people of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Nations ſhould be caſt upon an Iſland, and ſeeing no probability of getting thence, they agree upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:58538:190"/>Laws and Rules for the Common Good, and make choice of the wiſeſt Man amongſt them as their King, to rule and govern them according to thoſe Laws, can it then be ſaid, that the People received their Priviledges from him, or that he is not ſtrictly bound to govern them by thoſe Laws and no other?</hi> I deſire to ask this one Queſtion more: <hi>Whether the King is not bound, as well by his Oath as by the nature of the Government, to protect and defend every Subject in his juſt Rights and Properties?</hi> But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing his Doctrine as orthodox, yet his Reaſon is admirable; for the Subject is not to make a defence in any Caſe, if the King have any Title or Concern in it, all Corporations muſt deliver up their Charters of courſe, whenever a <hi>Quo War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranto</hi> is brought; and, why? becauſe it was a Grant from the King, and it would be very hard to oppoſe him with his own Gift: whoever holds any thing by Gift from the Crown, and tho' made as ſure as the Broad Seal can make it, yet if the King think good to queſtion it, the party muſt yield it up without inſiſting upon his Right, for the Reaſon given by the learned Judge: for the ſame Reaſon every Peer, if denied his Writ, muſt not demand it; nay, he muſt ſurrender his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and renounce his Title, as far as in him lies, if the King require it: And for the ſame reaſon, when any man is called to an account for his life, he muſt make no defence, but ſubmit himſelf to the King's Mercy; for all we have is from the King, and nothing muſt be diſputed when it is his pleaſure to queſtion it: This is indeed to make the King as <hi>abſolute</hi> as any thing on Earth can be, yet is withal to make him the moſt <hi>unjuſt Prince</hi> that ever ſate on the Engliſh Throne. This
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:58538:191"/>ſort of Juſtice is learnt from Children, whoſe Gifts continue good no longer than the Donor remains in that kind mood. Surely nothing can more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect Diſhonour upon the King, for it makes him as unjuſt and uncertain as any thing can be, both which ſhould not be in the Temper, much leſs in the Actings of a Prince.</p>
            <p>Another Reaſon was given, I think, by the Chief Juſtice, or elſe by Mr. Juſtice <hi>Holloway, becauſe it was abſolutely neceſſary for the ſecuring of the Peace, it was urg'd ſo far, as if the Peace could not be ſecured without it.</hi> Surely all this muſt be but <hi>gratis dictura,</hi> for my Lord <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> by find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sureties, had done all that the Law does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire for ſecuring the Peace, unleſs they had clapt him up a cloſe Priſoner; which they could not juſtifie, if he tender'd Sureties: and therefore, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my Lord <hi>Devonſhire</hi> is different from all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and a different method muſt be made uſe of to ſecure the Peace, or elſe this Argument of theirs ſavours not ſo much of Reaſon as of ſomething elſe, that ought to be no Ingredient when they give Judgment in any Caſe; and it ſurpaſſes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſence to underſtand, <hi>how the over-ruling my Lord's Plea could tend to the ſecuring of the Peace;</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Security which he had given muſt awe him to keep the Peace, or the other could not, for he had broke the Peace again, and repeated it ſeveral times before he came to his Trial, yet that could not effect the Merits of the Cauſe, neither could it be given in evidence at the Trial, ſo as to alter the ſtate of the Fact; neither could the Judges, by reaſon of it, enhaunce his Puniſhment if he were found guilty, but they muſt look upon it as a diſtinct Offence, and ſo might require the
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:58538:191"/>greater Security for the Peace, and for a longer time.</p>
            <p>Indeed it is an effectual way to prevent a man from breaking the Peace, to lay ſuch a Fine upon him as is impoſſible to be paid immediately, and to commit him till payment.</p>
            <p>It is too probable that the Judges being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious how liable they have made themſelves to be called in queſtion for this <hi>Sawcineſs</hi> and <hi>trampling upon the Law,</hi> would debaſe and bring under the Credit and Authority of this Court, becauſe no other can take cognizance of their proceedings, ſo as to correct their <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Miſtakes;</hi> it is only here that they can be called to an account for what they do amiſs, no Court can puniſh them but this; ſo that if they can once top your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, there is nothing that they need ſtand in awe of, nothing to reſtrain them, but they may act <hi>ad libitum,</hi> not <hi>per legem;</hi> for, let this Court be <hi>depreſt,</hi> and they may ſay, <hi>Of whom then need we be afraid?</hi> By what they have done already they have ſufficiently ſhewn to what Extravagances they will proceed when they think themſelves to be <hi>out of the reach of this Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If once the <hi>King's Bench</hi> can ſet it ſelf as high as the Judges have attempted by this proceeding againſt my Lord <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> then muſt the whole Nation (your Lordſhips not excepted) <hi>ſtoop to all the Extravagances and monſtrous Judgments that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry corrupt and ignorant fellow ſhall give, who ſhall chance to get up to the Bench;</hi> and not only this preſent Age ſhall feel and undergo the Miſchief, but it will be entail'd upon all ſucceeding Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Well then, did the Judges attempt that which would bring your Lordſhips ſo low, and
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:58538:192"/>raiſe their Court ſo high, to ſet it above all reach or controul, eſpecially if they did promiſe to themſelves Impunity, if not Reward, which they might have expected, had it been in the Reign of an arbitrary Prince, who would be a great gainer by the fall of this Court, becauſe then the Skreen betwixt the King and People is taken away.</p>
            <p>This is the firſt time that an inferiour Court did take upon it to invalid the Priviledges of a ſuperiour. Superiour Courts do ſometimes ſet aſide the Orders and Proceedings of Inferiour Courts, and yet in that caſe they proceed with that caution, that it is never done but when there is <hi>manifeſt Error,</hi> and the Law not duly purſued and obſerved; but in no caſe was it known that they ever meddled with their <hi>priviledges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If what the Judges have done is <hi>good,</hi> I cannot tell what <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> they may not pretend to, for no <hi>bounds</hi> nor <hi>limits</hi> can be ſet to the <hi>King's Bench;</hi> it may aſſume as great a power in <hi>Civil Affairs</hi> as the <hi>High Commiſſion</hi> does in <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical,</hi> in their Actings not to be tyed up to any Rules or Method, but to vary and alter them as well as the <hi>Law,</hi> when occaſion or humor ſerves, the <hi>proceedings</hi> ſhall be as ſummary, or as delatory as they think fit, and your Lordſhips ſhall no more than other people be exempted from the exerciſe of that power.</p>
            <p>Therefore if your Lordſhips will not prevent the Miſchief from ſpreading it ſelf over the whole <hi>Nation,</hi> yet I hope you will take notice of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury you have ſuffer'd in the Caſe of my Lord <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonſhire,</hi> and to do your ſelves Right.</p>
            <pb n="573" facs="tcp:58538:192"/>
            <p>The <hi>Law</hi> has for the moſt part left <hi>Fines</hi> to the <hi>Diſcretion of the Judges,</hi> yet it is to be ſuch a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretion</hi> as is defin'd by my Lord <hi>Coke, fol.</hi> 56. <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcretio eſt diſcernere per legem quid ſit Juſtans;</hi> not to proceed according to their own Will and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Affection, for <hi>Talis diſcretio, diſcretionem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundit,</hi> as <hi>Wing at</hi> ſays, <hi>fol.</hi> 201. So that the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is not <hi>Whether the Judges could fine my Lord</hi> Devonſhire, but <hi>Whether they have kept themſelves within the bounds and limits which the Law has ſet them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſo very evident, as not to be made a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, whether in thoſe things which are left to the <hi>Diſcretion</hi> of the <hi>Judges,</hi> that the Law has ſet them bounds and limits, which, as God ſays to the Waves of the Sea, <hi>Hitherto ſhalt thou go, and no farther;</hi> for either they are ſo reſtrained, or elſe the <hi>Law</hi> does ſuppoſe them to be <hi>exempted from thoſe Frailties and Paſſions which do attend the reſt of Mankind:</hi> But as they cannot be ſuppos'd to be void of <hi>Paſſions</hi> and <hi>Infirmities,</hi> no leſs than other Men, ſo it cannot be imagin'd, that the <hi>Law</hi> has left Men to ſo wild a <hi>Juſtice</hi> as is guided by <hi>Paſſion</hi> and <hi>Affection,</hi> for it had been ſo great a Defect in the <hi>Conſtitution of this Government,</hi> that long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this it would have been reform'd. And as it is moſt clear, that they are thus reſtrain'd, ſo thoſe <hi>bounds</hi> and <hi>limits</hi> are no leſs known to them that are acquainted with the <hi>Law;</hi> there are two things which have heretofore been look'd upon as very good Guides, 1ſt, <hi>What has formerly been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly done in the like Caſe;</hi> 2ly, <hi>For want of ſuch particular Direction, then to conſider that which comes the neareſt to it, and ſo proportionably to add or abate, as the manner and circumſtance of the Caſe do require.</hi>
               <pb n="574" facs="tcp:58538:193"/>Theſe were thought very good and ſafe <hi>Directions,</hi> till it was declared, and ever ſince has been <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed</hi> in the <hi>King's Bench,</hi> that they did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard <hi>Preſidents, but would make them;</hi> and for ought that I can learn or find, this of my Lord <hi>Devonſhire</hi> is an <hi>Original.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What Obſcurity ſoever may be pretended in other Caſes, yet in this the Law has given ſo poſitive and plain a <hi>Direction,</hi> that it ſeems very ſtrange how they came to lay a Fine of 30000 <hi>l.</hi> upon my Lord <hi>Devonſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Court of <hi>Starchamber</hi> was taken away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the <hi>unmeaſurable Fines</hi> which it impos'd, which alone was a plain and direct prohibition for any other Court to do the like, for otherwiſe the Miſchief remain'd; for what Advantage was it to the Nation, if it had not been wholly ſuppreſt? the <hi>ſhifting of Hands</hi> gave the People no <hi>Eaſe</hi> in the <hi>Burden</hi> that lay upon them; it was all one whether the <hi>Starchamber</hi> or <hi>King's Bench</hi> did cruſh them by immoderate Fines. But to put all out of diſpute, the Statute 17 <hi>Car.</hi> ſays expreſly, That <hi>from henceforth no Court, Council, or place of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhall be erected, ordained, conſtituted, or appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted within this Realm of</hi> England, <hi>or Dominion of</hi> Wales, <hi>which ſhall have, uſe, or exerciſe the ſame, or the like Juriſdiction, as is or hath been uſed, practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or exerciſed in the ſaid Court of</hi> Starchamber: And this was upon very good reaſon, becauſe thoſe great <hi>Fines</hi> impoſed in that Court, were <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent</hi> with the Law of <hi>England,</hi> which is a <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Mercy,</hi> and concludes every <hi>Fine</hi> which is left at diſcretion, with <hi>Salvo Contenimento.</hi> If the Fines impoſed in the <hi>Starchamber</hi> were an <hi>intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Burden to the Subject, and the means to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:58538:193"/>an Arbitrary Power and Government,</hi> as that Statute recites, the like proceeding in the <hi>King's Bench</hi> can be no leſs grievous, and muſt produce the ſame Evil. Laws that are made upon new occaſions, or ſudden immergencies, the Reaſon upon which they were made may ceaſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently they do ceaſe alſo; but Laws that are grounded upon the <hi>ancient Principles of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> cannot ceaſe, becauſe the Reaſon of them will ever continue; and this Statute of 17 <hi>Car.</hi> being ſuch, no doubt holds good, and is now in as much force as the firſt moment in which it was made; and therefore this <hi>Fine</hi> impoſed on my Lord <hi>Devonſhire</hi> is in open defiance of that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute.</p>
            <p>I think no man can altogether excuſe my Lord <hi>Devonſhire;</hi> for my part I don't, but think it was a very inconſiderate raſh act, and I believe the <hi>Indiſcretion</hi> of it abſtracted from the <hi>Fine</hi> is a very ſenſible trouble to him; yet if thoſe things were wanting which may be urg'd in his <hi>excuſe,</hi> the <hi>Offence</hi> and <hi>Puniſhment</hi> don't ſeem to bear propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Could not the <hi>Merits</hi> of his <hi>Father</hi> be laid in the balance, nor the Surprize of meeting Coll. <hi>Culpepper?</hi> for my Lord having been abuſed by him, a man of ſo great Courage and Honour as my Lord <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> muſt needs feel and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it a long time, having received no ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or reparation made him for it; but if there were nothing of this in the Caſe, could all that may be ſaid to alleviate his <hi>Offence</hi> be urg'd againſt him with a double weight, were the Circumſtances of the <hi>Fact</hi> as foul and aggravating as the <hi>Malice</hi> of his <hi>Enemies</hi> could wiſh, yet ſurely a leſs <hi>Fine</hi> might have ſerv'd, for the <hi>Law</hi> caſts in a great
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:58538:194"/>many grains of <hi>Mercy</hi> into every <hi>Judgment,</hi> and has ever look'd upon a over-rigid <hi>proſecution of the Guilty to be no leſs Tyranny than the proſecution of the Not guilty,</hi> becauſe it is <hi>Summum jus,</hi> and has declar'd that to be <hi>Summa Injuria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But beſides all this, I do conceive with ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that <hi>where the Law has intruſted the Judges with a power to fine, it is in a much leſs degree than they have done in this Caſe:</hi> Firſt, becauſe the <hi>Law</hi> is very cautious whom and with what it does intruſt: it repoſes a great confidence in the King, yet in ſome caſes his Acts are not regarded by it, as the King can do no <hi>Miniſterial Act,</hi> a Commitment <hi>per ſpeciale mandatum Dom. regis,</hi> is a void Commitment: Where there lies an Action in caſe of Wrong done to the Party, the Acts of the King in thoſe caſes, according to the old Law Phraſe, <hi>are to be holden for none.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Becauſe Liberty is ſo precious in the eye of the Law, it is of ſo tender a regard, that it has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd the whole diſpoſe thereof to its own immediate direction, and left no part of it to the Diſcretion of the Judges, and what the Law will not ſuffer to be done directly, it does forbid that it be done indirectly or by a ſide-wind;</hi> and ſo conſequently the Judges can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not impoſe a greater Fine than what the Party may be capable of paying immediately into Court: but if the Judges may commit the Party to Priſon till the Fine be paid, and withal ſet ſo great a Fine as is impoſſible for the Party to pay into Court, then it will depend upon the Judges pleaſure, whether he ſhall ever have his <hi>Liberty,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Fine</hi> may be ſuch as he ſhall never be able to pay: And thus every Man's Liberty is
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:58538:194"/>wreſted out of the diſpoſe of the <hi>Law,</hi> and is ſtuck under the <hi>Girdle</hi> of the Judges.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Becauſe the <hi>Nation</hi> has an <hi>Intereſt</hi> in the Perſon of every particular Subject, for every Man, either one way or other, is uſeful and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable in his Generation, but by theſe <hi>intolerable Fines</hi> the <hi>Nation</hi> will frequently loſe a Member, and the Perſon that is Fin'd ſhall not only be diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled from doing his Part in the Common-wealth, but alſo he and his Family will become a <hi>Burden</hi> to the Land, eſpecially if he be a man of no great Eſtate, for the exceſſive Charge that attends a Confinement will quickly conſume all that he has, and then he and his <hi>Family</hi> muſt live upon <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> And thus the poor man will be doubly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd, firſt, to wear out his days in <hi>perpetual Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment;</hi> and ſecondly, to ſee Himſelf and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily brought to a Morſel of Bread.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Becauſe in all great <hi>Caſes,</hi> and ſuch as require a grievous Puniſhment, the Law has in certain awarded the Judgment, and next to Life and corruption of Blood, a ſeverer Puniſhment cannot be impos'd, than to be <hi>Fin'd</hi> more than a man can pay, and to lye in Priſon till he does: But if ſome great Caſes did happen, which could not be foreſeen, it was always uſual with the <hi>Judges,</hi> when any ſuch Caſe came before them, to adjourn it to the Parliament, which had been needleſs, if they could have puniſh'd at the rate that our Judges have of late done.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Becauſe where-ever the <hi>Law</hi> has ſet down a <hi>Fine,</hi> either by way of <hi>Puniſhment</hi> or <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> it ſeldom exceeds 2000 <hi>l.</hi> Nay, even in that tender place of Liberty, <hi>if a Judge ſhall not relieve with an</hi> Habeas Corpus, <hi>but let the perſon
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:58538:195"/>languiſh in Priſon, yet the third Offence is but</hi> 2000 <hi>l. Penalty;</hi> and I ſuppoſe that that is but inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, in compariſon of what any of the Judges are worth, yet it being taken as a Puniſhment, is by the Law look'd upon as a great Sum.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Becauſe the Law of <hi>England</hi> being a <hi>Law of Mercy,</hi> and very careful to prevent <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> and to that end having for almoſt every <hi>Offence</hi> appointed its particular Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, it cannot be ſuppos'd to have left ſo great a power in the <hi>Judges,</hi> as they have exerted in this Caſe. True it is, ſome things are left to their <hi>Diſcretion,</hi> becauſe it was not poſſible to foreſee every particular Caſe that might happen, yet they are things of the leaſt ſize that are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to their Judgment, for (as was ſaid before) <hi>matters of any conſiderable moment were ſtill refer'd to the Parliament,</hi> as alſo the review of what the Judges ſhould do in thoſe leſſer matters, which were left to their Diſcretion.</p>
            <p>As theſe Proceedings are a great Wrong to the <hi>Subject,</hi> ſo are they no leſs a Diſadvantage to the <hi>King,</hi> becauſe they will make his Government look very rigid and ſevere, and gives it a grim fierce Countenance, which, tho' I don't ſay that it will make the People rebel, yet I am apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that it will ſet them upon their guard; its fair and gentle uſage, that prevails upon reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and free-born Men; it's an eaſie Government that will bow the Hearts of the People of <hi>England,</hi> for, ſays the Statute <hi>P.M.</hi> That <hi>the Eſtate of a King ſtandeth more aſſured by the love of his Subjects than in fear of Laws;</hi> ſo that the King will be on the <hi>loſing band</hi> by theſe proceedings, becauſe it ſpoils the complexion of his Government.</p>
            <pb n="579" facs="tcp:58538:195"/>
            <p>And the King will yet be a farther Sufferer, for if 30000 <hi>l.</hi> be the price of a <hi>Blow,</hi> it will make <hi>White-hall</hi> very empty, for he that goes thither muſt approach it with fear and trembling, becauſe he does not know but he ſhall be ruin'd before he comes thence; for though a man arm himſelf with all the Reſolution he can, yet it cannot be Proof againſt the Contrivance of thoſe that intend to do him a Miſchief, eſpecially if he is not upon very good terms at Court, there will never want thoſe who will endeavour to draw him into the Snare, hoping to merit by it, though perhaps they miſtake their aim; yet however, <hi>Revenge,</hi> that is ſo ſweet, will be greatly encourag'd to provoke him, becauſe he cannot hope to reek his Malice ſo plentifully as this way, becauſe if his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>mpt ſucceed, the other is ruin'd: nay, if he do not ſtrike, but only defend himſelf, yet if the Judges don't like the Complexion of the Man, they will call the <hi>Fox's Ears Horns,</hi> and lay all the Blame on his Back, and pronounce him more guilty that looks over the <hi>Hedge,</hi> than he that <hi>ſteals the Horſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since the Buſineſs of my Lord <hi>Devonſhire</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, I have heard him blam'd as the Author of his own Misfortune, and that he drew the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief upon himſelf; and the Reaſon given, was, <hi>becauſe he ought not to have gone to Court; for,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>he knew there were many there who wiſh'd him ill, and therefore ſooner or later he would meet with an Affront, and if he once fell into their Hands, he muſt expect no Quarter,</hi> becauſe Coll. <hi>Culpepper,</hi> who, without any provocation of my Lord's part, had ſo unneceſſarily fallen upon him, and had by drawing Blood upon my Lord forfeited his Hand;
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:58538:196"/>yet not only that, but all the reſt of the Judgment was pardoned, and therefore as well that as this are look'd upon as buſineſſes that were laid. But in ſaying this, I only tell your Lordſhips what is ſaid <hi>without doors,</hi> and I don't ſpeak it as my <hi>Opinion,</hi> but ſetting the tattle without doors aſide, I do conceive, <hi>that can never be a juſt Judgment which injures the King as well as the party that is puniſh'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the true nature of my Lord <hi>Devonſhire</hi>'s <hi>Offence</hi> has not yet been throughly conſidered; the <hi>Law</hi> does in all caſes give great Allowances to what is done on a <hi>ſudden heat,</hi> where there does not appear any <hi>Premeditation;</hi> and for this Reaſon, when a man is indicted for Murder, if upon the Evidence there does not appear <hi>Malice prepence</hi> either expreſs'd or imply'd, the Party ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed ſhall have his <hi>Clergy:</hi> and for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, though it be <hi>Death</hi> to maim or disfigure another, yet if it be done on a <hi>ſudden heat,</hi> the Party ſhall not dye for it; for in theſe and the like caſes the Law thinks him to be more blame wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy who gave the Provocation, than he that was ſo provok'd, becauſe it was not the effect of an evil <hi>Mind,</hi> but of <hi>Paſſion; Et actus non ſit reus niſimens ſit rea.</hi> If therefore it be true which I have heard, That the King promiſed my Lord <hi>Devonſh.</hi> that Coll. <hi>Culpepper</hi> ſhould never come to <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi> it will then follow, that my Lord <hi>Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi>'s ſtriking Coll. <hi>Culpepper</hi> was the effect of Paſſion, and not of Intention, becauſe he could not expect to meet him where he did. If ſo, I conceive with ſubmiſſion, that the Puniſhment and Offence don't in any meaſure bear propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <pb n="581" facs="tcp:58538:196" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>But I am perſwaded that the Judges were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon what they have done before they heard the Cauſe, in caſe my Lord was found guilty, and the rather, becauſe my Lord Chief Juſtice was harranguing the Offence beforehand; for when my Lord <hi>Devonſhire</hi> appeared 6. <hi>May,</hi> he told him, that to ſtrike in the King's Palace was little leſs, or next door to pulling the King out of his Throne: Indeed, on the laſt day of the Term he did explain them thus; That the Time and Circumſtances might be ſuch, as it would be little leſs than the aſſaulting the King in his Throne: But ſeveral have told me, who heard him, and they ſay, The firſt words of <hi>Time and Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> were not mention'd by him 6. <hi>May;</hi> and in particular, a Noble Lord of this Houſe is one from whom I had my Information; and if it were ſo, thoſe words ſavour too much of a prejudging the Cauſe.</p>
            <p>There is no doubt, but in caſe of a <hi>Fine</hi> ſet the Court may commit the Party, in caſe of obſtinacy, for not paying the Fine into Court, yet this is to be taken <hi>cum grano ſalis,</hi> for if the <hi>Fine</hi> be immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, or elſe he has not the Money then ready, but either offers Security to pay it, or elſe prays for ſome time, and in the interim to ſtand upon his Recognizance in either of theſe Caſes: to <hi>commit</hi> for not paying the <hi>Fine</hi> into Court, is not juſtifiable, becauſe it is to puniſh for not doing an Impoſſibility, for <hi>Lex non legit ad impoſſibilia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, It is not juſtifiable, becauſe if the <hi>Fine</hi> be paid, the Law is as much ſatisfied if it be paid five years hence, as if it be paid then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately into Court, for the <hi>Law</hi> does not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:58538:197"/>that the moſt wealthy man does carry ſo much Money about him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is very unreaſonable, becauſe it does in a great part diſable the perſon to pay the <hi>Fine;</hi> for if he be a man that manages his own Affairs, his Writings, that are neceſſary to make the Security, may be ſo diſpos'd of, that it will be difficult to come at them; beſides, there being a neceſſity upon him to have the Money, thoſe of whom he is to have it will be very apt to hold him to harder terms, for the World is ſo unnatural and brutiſh, that one man is but too prone to make his Advantages upon the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes and Neceſſities of another; and that Proverb <hi>Homo homini lupus,</hi> is in no Caſe more true than in the buſineſs of Money.</p>

<pb n="584" facs="tcp:58538:198"/>into it; and therefore it paſſes all our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, that this Sett of <hi>Judges,</hi> who had not <hi>Law</hi> enough to employ them at the <hi>Bar,</hi> before they were raiſed to the <hi>Bench,</hi> ſhould find out the <hi>Secret,</hi> and give an <hi>Abſolute Opinion,</hi> for which there is not any preſident to be produced, and therefore ſhrewdly to be ſuſpected that it is not grounded upon <hi>Law,</hi> no more than thoſe Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions were for which ſeveral <hi>Judges</hi> have been <hi>hanged.</hi> The Law of <hi>England</hi> has ever been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to be as <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>intelligible</hi> as that of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which was written on the <hi>Palms of their Hands,</hi> ſave only when Judges are ignorant and needy, and are aſſured that Parliaments are at a great diſtance, and then only are ſuch Opinions as thoſe given, for their <hi>Ignorance</hi> makes them aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, their <hi>Poverty</hi> makes them leap before they look, and when <hi>Parliaments</hi> ſeem very remote, under that ſhelter they grow bold: But it is to be hoped, that ſuch Opinions as theſe will paſs for <hi>Law</hi> no longer than the Nation is govern'd without a <hi>Parliament,</hi> which, ſooner or later, will come as certain as that there will be a <hi>Day of Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſtrange that theſe <hi>Judges</hi> ſhould underſtand ſo great a Myſtery as this, unleſs there be as great Vertue in a Judge's Gown as was in the <hi>Mantle</hi> of <hi>Elijah;</hi> and if ſo, how happens it that the ſame Spirit has not reſted on thoſe who have ſate before them on the <hi>Bench;</hi> but if a double Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Excellent Spirit is reſted upon our preſent Judges, that they are able to dive into ſo great a Myſtery as this, and ſee ſo much further than any who have been before them, ſurely they are alſo endowed with the Tongue of <hi>Angles,</hi> and
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:58538:198"/>ſo can explain this matter to the Underſtandings of the People; which in Duty they are bound to do, or elſe in time, with the price of their <hi>Heads,</hi> they may come to give the true Reaſons of this their Opinion:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Kings of</hi> England <hi>are Soveraign Princes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That the Laws of</hi> England <hi>are the King's Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That therefore it is an incident inſeparable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative in the Kings of</hi> England, <hi>as in all other Soveraign Princes, to diſpenſe with all Penal Laws in particular Caſes, and upon particular neceſſary Reaſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>That of theſe Reaſons and Neceſſities the King himſelf is the ſole Judge; and which is conſequent thereupon,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>That this is not a Truſt inveſted in or granted to the King, but the ancient Remains of the Soveraign Power and Prerogative of the Kings of</hi> England, <hi>which never was yet taken from them, nor can be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore in this Caſe ſuch Diſpenſation being pleaded by the Defendant, and ſuch Diſpenſation being allow'd by the Demurrer of the Plaintiff, and this Diſpenſation appearing upon <hi>Record</hi> to come time enough to ſave the Defendant from the <hi>forfeiture,</hi> Judgment ought to be given for the Defendant <hi>&amp; quod querens nil capiat per billam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Soveraign Power</hi> is of a vaſt extent, that is as much as unlimited, and to which no Bounds is or can be ſet. That the Kings of <hi>England</hi> in Parliament have a <hi>Soveraign Power,</hi> is true; that with the Conſent and Concurrence of the Lords
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:58538:199"/>and Commons he may do what he will, is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion; and it is as certain, that out of Parliament his Power is limited and confined within certain Bounds and Limits, which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not paſs without doing violence to Juſtice and the Laws; for there are two Powers in the King, the one in <hi>Parliament,</hi> and that is <hi>Soveraign;</hi> the other out of <hi>Parliament,</hi> which may be directed and controuled by the former, and therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Poteſtas ſubordinata, pag.</hi> 10. <hi>Rights of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, p.</hi> 9. <hi>Argument of Property;</hi> therefore his Power is <hi>Soveraign,</hi> only <hi>ſub modo;</hi> for out of Parliament many of his Acts are not only queſtionable, but void in themſelves,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rights of the Kingdom,</hi> 83.</note> for what he ſhall do againſt <hi>Law,</hi> thoſe Acts bind no more than if they were a Child's, he cannot command one man to kill another, he cannot pardon a common Nuſance, nor an Appeal at the ſuit of the Party. And multitudes of the like Inſtances might be given; for if the <hi>King's power</hi> out of Parliament was as great as in Parliament, then there's an end of the Policy of this <hi>Government,</hi> and the <hi>Barons Wars</hi> was only to beat the Air.</p>
            <p>It is moſt certain, that till theſe late days, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which we have been ſo very much Frenchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Roads are called the King's Highway, but the Freehold is in the Lord of the Soil, and of the Profits growing there as Trees,</hi> &amp;c. Terms of the Law, 56.</note> that the <hi>Laws</hi> have been more frequently ſtiled or called the <hi>Laws of the Land,</hi> than the <hi>King's Laws;</hi> and therefore if the Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of them declares the right, the King will be found to have no very <hi>ſtrong Title.</hi> But if they had conſtantly been called the <hi>King's
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:58538:199"/>Laws,</hi> yet that is a very Sandy Foundation to build a <hi>power</hi> upon of <hi>ſuſpending</hi> and <hi>diſpenſing</hi> with them at his pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Now, if they are the <hi>King's Laws,</hi> then he only made them; but if the Lords and Commons alſo had their ſhare in the contriving and making of them, then that Advice and Conſent of theirs gives them ſuch a Title to an Intereſt in them, that they cannot be <hi>changed</hi> or <hi>altered,</hi> no more than they could be enacted, without their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, for nothing can deſtroy a thing but the ſame Power that made it; and therefore, unleſs the King alone be the ſame power that enacted the Laws, they cannot be properly called <hi>his Laws,</hi> ſo as that at his will and pleaſure he may diſpenſe with them.</p>
            <p>But if the <hi>Laws</hi> were <hi>made</hi> and <hi>enacted</hi> by him only, yet it does not follow, that the King may diſpenſe with the <hi>Laws</hi> when to him it ſhall ſeem meet; for there is no King ſo <hi>abſolute,</hi> but may be <hi>limited.</hi> Thus we ſee the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Kings, who were as <hi>abſolute</hi> as any Princes upon Earth, yet were limited and reſtrained by their own Promiſes and Acts. Even that great King <hi>Abaſuerus,</hi> who had Ruled over 127 Provinces, when he had made a Decree, he could not revoke, change, or diſpenſe with it; for the Writing which is written in the King's Name, and ſealed with the King's Ring, <hi>may no man reverſe, Eſth.</hi> 8.8. no, nor the King himſelf; which is clear from that famous caſe of the Decree to deſtroy the <hi>Jews,</hi> to reverſe or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpend which it's plain, he wanted not Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and if ever, would then have exerted his full power, for he was prick'd on by all the Spurs and Inducements that could be in any caſe, yet all he
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:58538:200"/>could do was, to give the <hi>Jews</hi> leave to defend themſelves; therefore if thoſe Heathen Kings were ſo bound by their Word and Laws of the Country, it's reaſonable to ſuppoſe that Chriſtian Princes ſhould be as much tyed up by their Words and the Laws; and if the King be bound by his Word and the Laws, which he ſhall not paſs, then is he under the ſame obligation as if he had actually gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his aſſent to every Law that is now in force, becauſe he has given his Word, and taken an Oath <hi>to preſerve and maintain all the Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it ſeems ſomething ſtrange, to hear of a power to diſpenſe with Penal Laws, there being ſo late a Judgment againſt it, the late King in Parliament diſclaiming it: and the whole Caſe is very remarkable, for during the interval of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, he grants a Declaration of <hi>Indulgence,</hi> and at the meeting of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment tells them,
<note place="margin">Nothing of force or conſtraint brought him to make that Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the Truth was too evident to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied.</note> 
               <hi>he had done it, and would ſtand by it, and ſhould be very angry with any man that ſhould offer to diſſwade him againſt it.</hi> Yet though he had thus braved the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, within ten days, openly in Parliament, he diſclaimed it, and confeſſed, that he could not diſpenſe with a <hi>General Law,</hi> and had ordered the Seal to be pulled from the <hi>Declaration.</hi> Surely the Caſe muſt be very plain, that the King, after he had juſtified the thing ſo ſolemnly, yet ſhould ſo ſuddenly eat his words, and confeſs himſelf in the wrong, and to that Parliament too which had almoſt unhinged the Government to pleaſe him, which no doubt would have complied with him in it, had it been leſs than to lift the Government
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:58538:200"/>quite off of the Hooks. And indeed, to ſay that the King can <hi>diſpenſe</hi> with <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> is nothing leſs than to diſſolve the Government, and reſolve all into the <hi>King's Will and Pleaſure,</hi> for our <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments</hi> are then but a piece of <hi>Pageantry</hi> or <hi>Pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet-ſhow,</hi> becauſe in a word the King can annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late all that they ſhall do in many Ages, all the Proviſions that they ſhall make for the Good of the Nation are but <hi>airy notions</hi> and <hi>painted ſhews,</hi> they are, and they are not, juſt as the King pleaſes.</p>
            <p>Now, if the King can do this, to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe have ſeveral things been done? what means the Statute <hi>de Prerog. Regis,</hi> 17 <hi>Ed.</hi> II? for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it's a thing of a much higher and tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent nature, to have power to diſpenſe with all Penal Laws, than to have the Preheminence of the Subjects in ſome particular caſes only: That he has it not in all originally, is plain from that of Appeals; for in caſe of <hi>Murder,</hi> the <hi>Appeal,</hi> at the ſuit of the Party, was to be tryed before the <hi>Indictment,</hi> which was the King's Suit; and this was ſo till <hi>Henry</hi> VII's time, when it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd by Act of Parliament: and this carries in it a great probability, that there is ſomething in <hi>England</hi> that is his <hi>Superiour;</hi> but <hi>Bracton</hi> and <hi>Fleta</hi> ſay, That <hi>Rex habet ſuperieres in regno, nempe Deum Legem &amp; Parliamentum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, the <hi>Cuſtom</hi> of the <hi>Mannor</hi> ſhall bind the King.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Statutes</hi> to prevent <hi>Fraud</hi> ſhall bind the King.</p>
            <p>The King cannot give the <hi>Penalty</hi> of any <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute</hi> to any Subject; he cannot pardon a common <hi>Nuſance:</hi> how manifeſtly prepoſterous is it then to ſuppoſe, that the King can <hi>diſpenſe</hi> with <hi>Penal
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:58538:201"/>Laws,</hi> and is reſtrain'd in theſe and multitudes of other things of the like nature? It has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been taken for <hi>Law,</hi> that where the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject has an <hi>Intereſt,</hi> the King cannot pardon, and therefore he cannot pardon one found guilty, upon an <hi>Appeal</hi> at the Suit of the Party: But if he can diſpenſe with all <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> he may alſo pardon where the Subject has an Intereſt, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>diſpenſe</hi> with all Laws whatever, and then no man's Title to his Eſtate is good, nor can any man ſettle his Eſtate ſecurely, for Fines and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries being now the means uſed in Settlements, and thoſe being directed by particular Acts of Parliament: if therefore the King, for ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular neceſſary Reaſons, ſhall think fit to ſuſpend thoſe Laws, all the Settlements in <hi>England</hi> will be ſtrangely confuſed: and of how excellent a uſe, upon occaſion, it may be to diſpenſe with thoſe Statutes which direct <hi>Fines</hi> and <hi>Recoveries,</hi> is very eaſie to comprehend.</p>
            <p>Now, this power of diſpenſing ſeems to be of a very late date, for <hi>Forteſcue,</hi> who wrote in <hi>Henry</hi> VI's time, tells us, That <hi>the Kings of</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland <hi>cannot alter nor change the Laws of his Realm at his pleaſure:</hi> and the reaſon he gives of it is, <hi>becauſe he governs his People by Power not only royal, but alſo politick;</hi> which is by ſuch Laws as they themſelves deſire: and gives a very pregnant Reaſon why the King cannot alter nor change the Laws, <hi>becauſe the Laws of Men are holy.</hi> And he ſhews likewiſe, <hi>That this Reſtraint is no diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his Power, but does rather aggrandize him, it being a greater power in a Prince to be reſtrained by Law from oppreſſing, than to have an abſolute regal power.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="591" facs="tcp:58538:201"/>
            <p>Neceſſity is a very extenſive thing, unleſs it be limited to the Common Good, and to be alſo ſuch, that it is obſervable by the People; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ill Pretences will never want a <hi>Neceſſity</hi> for any <hi>Irregularity</hi> that they have an inclination to commit it; and ſo it will prove the Handle for all the Evil that the Wit and Malice of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and Wicked Men can invent, or which ſhall be committed under the Sun: And this alone will ſerve to make the Power of Princes nearer to that of God than any other thing whatever.</p>
            <p>The <hi>diſpenſing with the Laws</hi> on pretence of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Reaſons, was ſufficiently laughed out of countenance in the caſe of <hi>Ship money,</hi> which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a more probable ſhew with it than the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of <hi>diſpenſing with the Laws,</hi> to let <hi>Papiſts</hi> into Office; for in that of <hi>Ship-money,</hi> the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſtery of Neceſſity was ſo palpably unfolded and diſcovered, that it's ſtrange the ſame Trick ſhould be played again ſo ſoon, whilſt the Memory of it is yet freſh.</p>
            <p>It may as well be pretended, that what is done for the ſake of ſome few particular perſons is for the Common Good, and to pretend it's neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to <hi>diſpenſe</hi> with the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> to let <hi>Papiſts</hi> into Office; for the Laws to keep Papiſts out of Office, were made upon the greateſt Reaſon that could be, for by refuſing to take the Oaths, (which are but a reaſonable Security to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment) they do render themſelves more than ſuſpicious, that they look upon themſelves to be under another Juriſdiction, but by their frequent Plots and Conſpiracies they have made themſelves the declared Enemies of the Government, for they have been the Authors of all our Diſturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:58538:202"/>and the Fire that has lighted every Flame that has broke out in this Nation. And therefore it's highly reaſonable that they ſhould have no place in the <hi>Magiſtracy,</hi> and the <hi>Government</hi> is very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der towards them, that it ſuffers its <hi>profeſſed Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> to have any Benefit under it: And therefore to <hi>diſpenſe with the Laws</hi> that <hi>Papiſts</hi> may be let into Office, if this Neceſſity is juſtifiable, then may alſo any other that can be thought on to ſerve a preſent turn or occaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Government and Law,</hi> ſays <hi>Plato, is to preſerve the buge and undigeſted lump of a Multitude, and to bring all Diſorder into proportion, ſo as to become an Harmony.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the King of <hi>England</hi> has begotten all his Subjects, and ſo they are all Princes of the Blood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That <hi>God Almighty,</hi> in Holy Writ, has ſet down what form of Government every People in the World ſhall live under.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That this <hi>Government</hi> is exactly accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that <hi>Model</hi> in <hi>Holy Writ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That a King begot all his Subjects, is a thing never yet heard of, no, not ſo much as in a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The greateſt Divines that have been could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet find, that any ſort of <hi>Government</hi> was ſet down in <hi>Holy Writ</hi> as a <hi>Model</hi> to the ſeveral Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that are under the Sun; and the ſeveral <hi>forms of Government</hi> that there are in the World, is an undeniable proof that God left every People, the <hi>Jews</hi> excepted, to <hi>model and frame their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> as it ſuited and agreed beſt with the Humor and Diſpoſition of the People who were to live under it: and therefore it will follow, that the People of <hi>England</hi> did frame and chuſe the Laws and Conſtitutions under which they were to live and be governed by; and therefore it is undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that what Power ſoever the King can claim by <hi>Law,</hi> is a Truſt inveſted in and granted to him by the People; and if ſo, it cannot be ſuppoſed that they would give him ſuch a power, as to leave it to his diſcretion to diſpoſe of all they had as to him ſhould ſeem meet, for thereby they would render themſelves as ridiculous as <hi>Solomon</hi>'s fooliſh Woman, <hi>who pulls down her Houſe with her Hands:</hi> for <hi>Forteſcue</hi> ſays, That <hi>no Nation did ever
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:58538:203"/>of their own voluntary mind, incorporate themſelves into a Kingdom, for any other intent, but only to the end that they might with more ſafety than before maintain themſelves, and enjoy their Goods from ſuch Misfortunes and Loſſes as they ſtood in fear of; for no ſuch power ſurely could have proceeded from them,</hi> Forteſc. 34. But ſuppoſe that the People had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the King ſuch a power, yet it being repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Common Good, it ſeems to be void of it ſelf; for our Lawyers ſays, <hi>If the King be deceived in his Grant, he may revoke it.</hi> If then the King may do it when it concerns ſome trivial thing <hi>à fortiori,</hi> may the People revoke their Grant, if deceived in ſo high a point as their All?</p>
            <p>But further, in this Caſe of <hi>diſpenſing</hi> with <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Laws,</hi> as it violently tends to give up all to the King's will and pleaſure, ſo if all were at his diſpoſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et in regard that it does not anſwer to the end of <hi>Government,</hi> he cannot pretend to it; for the way of <hi>governing</hi> muſt be both right and clear, as well as is the end: but how that will appear in <hi>diſpenſing with the Laws,</hi> is as dark as a Beggar's Pedigree.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Lex fecit regem; A King is given for the Kingdom, and not the Kingdom for the King,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Thomas.</hi> And <hi>Forteſoue</hi> ſays, <hi>In a Body-politick the intent of the People is the firſt living thing, having within it Blood.</hi> That is to ſay, politick Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the Utility and Wealth of the ſame Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which it dealeth forth and imparteth as well to the Head as to all the Members of the ſame Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, whereby the Body is nouriſhed and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And he ſays further, That <hi>a King who rules by Power politick receives his Power from the People.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="595" facs="tcp:58538:203"/>
            <p>If it be objected, <hi>That many things are left to his Diſcretion;</hi> tho' it be great, yet that <hi>Diſcretion</hi> muſt be guided by Law, for <hi>Diſcretion and Law ſhould be concomitant, and the one to be an Accident inſeperable to the other.</hi> P. 31. Treat. of Bail.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Saxons,</hi> from whom we derive our <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> had all the Enſigns and Badges of <hi>Freedom,</hi> and ſeemed in the original conſtitution of it, to have with the utmoſt foreſight guarded thoſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues at which it was moſt likely to be attacked by <hi>Abſoluteneſs,</hi> being ſenſible and growing wiſe at the loſs of their Neighbors, that Kings are too prone to encroach upon the <hi>Peoples Rights,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though they yielded him a ſort of <hi>Subjection</hi> for the advancement of the Common Good, yet they took all the care they could to prevent being govern'd by his Will: for <hi>Dion</hi> ſaith, That <hi>the People held the Helm of Government in their own power.</hi> And another very good Authority ſays, That <hi>the</hi> Saxons <hi>were a free People, govern'd by Laws made by the People, and therefore called a free People, becauſe they are a Law to themſelves:</hi> Which <hi>Forteſcue, p.</hi> 26. does confirm, for he ſays, That <hi>a People govern'd by power politick are ruled by ſuch Laws as they themſelves deſire.</hi> Therefore, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all this, to ſay that the King can <hi>diſpenſe</hi> with all <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> and conſequently with all <hi>Laws,</hi> there is nonſence in one of the two, yet ſurely it will light upon that which is without preſident, rather than upon that which may be juſtified by that which has paſſed for Law till within theſe few months. Nothing ſeems more unnatural than this power of <hi>diſpenſing with the Laws;</hi> it thwarts the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> and the Dictates of <hi>Self-preſervation,</hi> and beſpeaks our Forefathers to
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:58538:204"/>be a company of <hi>Madmen,</hi> rather than men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated together for the mutual conſervation and good of each other.</p>
            <p>Now, that which gives as great a blow as any thing to this Opinion, is the place whence the <hi>Judges</hi> would fetch this power of <hi>diſpenſing;</hi> not from Preſidents, and a conſtant exerciſe of it, but from a dark obſcure Original, to perplex and not explain their Reſolution, to lead People into the dark, and not to make it clear to the Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings at firſt were <hi>Generals,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their power and inſtructions by which they were to act from the People; but the continual Wars occaſion'd the conſtant uſe of a General, and by degrees he became a ſetled Officer, and at laſt gained the Title of <hi>King,</hi> ſo that the <hi>Prerogative</hi> has always been on the gaining, not on the loſing hand; therefore there remains no Pretence of any higher power in the Crown, than what has been exerted by this and the late King; and if there be any ancient Remains of Power, it's what of right adheres to the People, becauſe they are the <hi>Original Power,</hi> unleſs the <hi>King</hi> or the <hi>Government</hi> come immediately from <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if this unbounded Power had been origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in the King, yet it cannot be ſo in him, but he might part with it, unleſs the Power of a King be advanced above that of <hi>King of kings</hi> and <hi>Lord of lords,</hi> for God Almighty is tyed up and bound by his Word, and having once given it, he cannot revoke or gainſay it.</p>

            <p>We humbly confeſs and acknowledge that we are ſinful Duſt and Aſhes, we were conceived and born in Sin, and have every moment of our lives added thereto many actual Tranſgreſſions, both of omiſſion and commiſſion; we have ſinned againſt clear Light and the Conviction of our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; we have lent a willing ear to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticements of Satan, and the Alurements of our Luſts and Corruption, but have turn'd a deaf ear to all the Calls and gracious Invitations that thou haſt given us to return into the path that leads to Life; we have endeavour'd to ſtifle the Checks of our Conſciences, and though we have not been able to blot out the impreſſion and belief that there is a God, yet we have too much lived like practical Atheiſts, and have walked ſo looſely and carnally as if there had been no God to whom we muſt render an account of all things we do here below, whether they be good or evil; we have ſinned beyond forgiveneſs, had not thy Mercy been grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than all thy works, and that thou canſt pardon more than we can offend.</p>
            <p>O Lord, poſſeſs us with a true ſence of thy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty, make every one of us ſenſible that we have done amiſs, let us bewail our Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the bottom of our Hearts, and make us truly ſorrowful that we have grieved thy Holy Spirits, and duly to conſider how ungrateful a thing it is to offend ſo good a God, a God <hi>by whom we live, move, and have our being,</hi> and from whom cometh every good and perfect Gift: make us

            <p>Good Lord, we beſeech thee to bleſs our King and Queen, in making them ever mindful for what end they were raiſed to ſo high a dignity as to ſit on the Throne of theſe Kingdoms, namely, to promote thy Glory, and the good and welfare of their People; let them ſee that this only is their beſt Intereſt, and that nothing can make them ſo great and happy as by being zealous there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: Let them with their Eyes drive away from their Throne all thoſe that would draw them aſide from thy Glory, or the Good of their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and teach them the <hi>things that belong to their Peace.</hi>

            <p>And let thy Bleſſing reſt upon this Family; lift up the <hi>light of thy Countenance</hi> upon us, and love us freely: as it is a Family of note and eminency ſo make it remarkable for ſobriety and good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and as it is above others, ſo let it be exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary for the good Converſation of every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of it, and thereby give occaſion to others to glorifie thee our Father which is in Heaven: Let us all be diſpoſed to do that which is good and acceptable; let thoſe that are to inſtruct others be careful to walk ſuitable to the Precepts which they teach; and thoſe that are to learn, let them be enclined and willing to receive Inſtruction: Let us all do our Duties faithfully and honeſtly, not with Eye-ſervice, like Brutes, but as Rational Creatures, that know how to chuſe the good and refuſe the evil.</p>

            <p>Look down in mercy upon this poor Nation, prevent thoſe Judgments which our Sins and Tranſgreſſions have called loud for againſt us, and cauſe thy Face to ſhine upon us; and to that end be merciful to the King, that he may ſee his true Intereſt, and let all his Deſigns and Conſultations be directed to the advancement of thy Glory and ſetling the Peace of this Land: let no weapon formed againſt this ancient Government proſper, and turn the deſigns of all thoſe who have Evil to our <hi>Sion,</hi> upon their own Heads with ſhame and confuſion, to the manifeſtation of thy Glory, and the Comfort of thoſe who wiſh her well: and to all thoſe whom thou ſhalt call out to have a ſhare in the adminiſtration of affairs, give them Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to ſee what they ought to do and ſay, and Courage to reveal what thou ſhalt put into their Hearts, and do it with an honeſt and upright intention, that they may have cauſe to hope for

            <p>And bleſs us alſo of this Family, all thoſe that are related unto it, and thoſe for whom any of us may be in a particular way concerned for: give us Grace to walk humbly and with obedience before thee; let us in our ſeveral employments and ſtations ſtudy to do our duty conſcientiouſly, ſetting thee before us in all our Actions: add un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us the good things of this Life, bleſs our Basket and Store, and ſo thankfully receive and carefully beſtow them, that they may be Bleſſings and not Snares to us: let us, whilſt we are here, live to thy praiſe and glory, and be ſuch eminent Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns of upright living, that others ſeeing our righteous converſation, may alſo glorifie thee our Father which is in Heaven.</p>

               <p>GRacious God, who out of thine infinite Goodneſs doſt allow us the favour of coming into thy preſence, and to make our Supplications unto thee, poſſeſs us, we beſeech thee, with ſuch a ſenſe and dread of thy Divine Majeſty, that our Thoughts may be ſo entirely intent upon the ſervice that we are now to perform, that it may be well-pleaſing to thee; and let all our Oblations be now and ever acceptable in thy ſight, O Lord, our Strength and Mighty Redeemer.</p>
               <p>GRacious God, who haſt made it our Duty, as well as our Intereſt, to draw nigh thee, aſſiſt us, we beſeech thee, in theſe our Supplications and Prayers, which we are now about to put up unto thee, and let all our Devotions be now and ever acceptable in thy ſight, O Lord, our Strength and Mighty Redeemer.</p>
               <p>WE bleſs thy Name for the Mercy of this day, in that thou haſt permitted us to hear thy Word read and preach'd. Grant, O Lord, that what we have heard may ſink down into our Hearts; and aſſiſt us, we beſeech thee, to endeavour to practiſe it in the remaining part of our Lives; and let it be the ſavour of Life to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of us, and not the ſavour of Death to
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:58538:210"/>any: continue thy Goſpel amongſt us, and let not the cloud of Superſtition or Idolatry over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread and darken theſe Realms.</p>
               <p>RAiſe us up in the Morning prepared for the Duties of the day enſuing; let us fix our Thoughts upon the great and holy buſineſs of that day; and not haſtily ruſh into thy preſence till we have deliberately thought upon what we are to do: let us come in meekneſs and humility, that we may hope to meet thee in thine Ordinance, and be ſent away with a Bleſſing. Hear us, O Lord, and anſwer us not according to our deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and unworthineſs, or coolneſs in asking, but according to thy love in Jeſus Chriſt; to whom, with thy ſelf and the Bleſſed Spirit, be all Praiſe and Adoration, both now and for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>RAiſe us up in the Morning fitted for our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Duties and Stations, and ſuch of us as are deſign'd to undertake a Journey, go along with us, and preſerve us from thoſe dangers and accidents to which we are then more eſpecially ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed: guide us in our way, and return us in Grace and Safety, and let us all at laſt meet in thy Kingdom. Theſe and all other thy Mercies we beg, for the ſake of thy Son Chriſt Jeſus our Lord and Saviour; to whom, with thee and the Holy Ghoſt, be all Praiſe and Adoration, both now and for evermore. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>AND we bleſs thy great and holy Name that thou haſt brought us back again in Peace and Safety to this place: through thy great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs we were preſerv'd from thouſands of Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents to which we were then more eſpecially ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. Let us ever be mindful, we beſeech thee, of thy Goodneſs, and endeavour to walk worthy of thy Mercy and Protection.</p>
               <p>ACcept, we pray thee, our Thanks for thy lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Servant; we acknowledge thy Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that he is in ſo good a way of recovery; and bleſs the Means that are uſed of recovery: perfect, we beſeech thee, the good work that thou haſt begun, and ſave his Life, and let him live to be a good old Man; and let us all learn to ſee how frail we are, and that in thee <hi>we live, move, and have our being.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WE deſire at this time in particular to offer up our Praiſes to thee, for the ſafe return of thy Servant after a long Abſence and tedious Journey; great are our obligations to thee, that we are again met together, and ſee the Faces of one another with ſo much comfort: thy Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs has notably appeared in reſtoring ſeveral of them to their health, who were ſo near the Grave: it was not for any Righteouſneſs or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert in us, that thou haſt dealt thus graciouſly with us, but thou art merciful becauſe thou wilt be merciful.

               <p>And as for him, as he is like to be a great, ſo make him a good man, give him Grace, that he may <hi>remember</hi> his <hi>Creator in the days of</hi> his <hi>Youth;</hi> let him fear God, and eſchew Evil; give him a true Zeal for thy Glory and the Good of his Country, and make him an eminent promoter of both: Let him <hi>walk cloſely with thee all the days of his life,</hi> that after he has accompliſh'd a good old age here, he may then be received into <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Boſom.</p>

            <head>SOME MEMOIRS OF THE METHODS Uſed in the Two Laſt Reigns.</head>
            <p>IT having been uſual, upon theſe Occaſions, for the Bench to ſay ſomething to the <hi>Grand Jury,</hi> I am apt to believe it may be expected at this time, ſince it is very probable, that many now preſent came hither as well out of curioſity to hear what is given in charge to the <hi>Grand Jury,</hi> as to ſee what ſort of men would ſit upon the Bench.</p>
            <p>When I obtain'd the King's Leave to come home, I did not expect to have met you here, ſo that I have had very little time to prepare for this Undertaking, and therefore fear I ſhall not acquit
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:58538:213"/>my ſelf ſo much to your ſatisfaction as might be hoped, and I could deſire.</p>
            <p>What I have to ſay is not to fall ſoul upon any under a Cloud, for I don't deſire to fit heavier upon any man than is neceſſary; ſo I would, if poſſible, prevent unreaſonable men from ſetting their Feet again upon our Necks.</p>
            <p>I need not tell you, that we were lately upon <hi>the Brink of Deſtruction,</hi> nor ſay any thing to aggravate the matter, to make you ſenſible of the <hi>Condition</hi> we were in; but perhaps many of you may have <hi>forgot,</hi> or are not throughly <hi>informed</hi> how long and by what methods the <hi>Deſign</hi> was carried on; and to that I will apply my <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Deſign of <hi>extirpating our Religion and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties</hi> is of a much ancienter date than the Reign of the late King <hi>James,</hi> for he took up the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as others had left it, and gave the <hi>finiſhing ſtroke</hi> to that of which there was violent Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes very early, in the Reign of K. <hi>James</hi> I. but being under a neceſſity of doing every thing obliquely, and by a <hi>ſide-wind,</hi> till the time of King <hi>Charles</hi> II, it would take up more time than can now be ſpared, to explain the tranſaction of thoſe Times, and therefore I only obſerve how the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter has been carried on ſince the Reſtauration of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second.</p>
            <p>That King had no ſooner ſet his Foot again on <hi>Engliſh Ground,</hi> but the deſign of depriving us both of our <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> appeared, tho' in diſguiſe, and in a ſhort time had made a great progreſs, through the favour of that King, who aſſiſted it all manner of ways, as well by <hi>Rewards <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Favours,</hi> ſo that at laſt it became a Teſt upon
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:58538:213"/>all Perſons that would be preferred or employed, their <hi>Inclinations to ſerve that Intereſt</hi> being more regarded than their other <hi>Abilities</hi> or <hi>Qualifications;</hi> but whether King <hi>Charles</hi> therein follow'd his own <hi>Inclinations,</hi> or was impos'd upon in what he did, I will not now enquire further, leſt I ſhould be thought to take too far into the <hi>Aſhes of the Dead;</hi> and therefore I will leave other People to judge, whether he that underſtood all other things ſo well, could be ſo very groſly impos'd upon in this, or that he could be over-reach'd by his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whoſe <hi>Intellects</hi> were ſo much inferiour to his.</p>
            <p>Thus, by the alurement of <hi>Preferment</hi> and <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,</hi> they did hope to draw in many <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> to lend their <hi>helping hand,</hi> becauſe without their <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> they could not carry on the <hi>Work;</hi> and though <hi>Employments</hi> could not be had at any other rate, yet the <hi>Looſeneſs</hi> and <hi>Debauchery</hi> that had then overſpread the Land, to which the Example of the King had not a little contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, had prepared a ſort of Men to take <hi>Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> on thoſe terms; and the more effectually to do the Buſineſs, they were to carry it on under the <hi>diſguiſe of Loyalty and the Church,</hi> for with theſe they varniſh'd over all thoſe <hi>unreaſonable things</hi> that were impos'd upon us; and indeed the Tools work'd very keenly, for as their <hi>Zeal</hi> was without <hi>Knowledge,</hi> ſo they went on at that furious ſenſeleſs rate, as thereby they quickly gave all thinking Men to underſtand, that the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> that was to be here <hi>eſtabliſh'd,</hi> the one was to be <hi>ſupported</hi> by <hi>Perſecution,</hi> and the other by <hi>Force.</hi>

            <pb n="616" facs="tcp:58538:215"/>
            <p>But that I may open this matter more <hi>clearly,</hi> I muſt obſerve, that the force of all their <hi>Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours</hi> ſeem'd to tend more eſpecially to ſet up <hi>Arbitrary Power;</hi> and the reaſon of it was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if they <hi>attain'd</hi> that, they were certain to carry the other: and in this they follow'd the <hi>method</hi> that has ever been taken to introduce <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery;</hi> for if a People are once made <hi>Slaves,</hi> it's eaſie to impoſe any <hi>Religion</hi> upon them: So that if we can keep our ſelves <hi>Freemen,</hi> we need not fear the <hi>loſs</hi> of our <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, they could not think of any way of <hi>rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> the <hi>Prerogative</hi> to ſo high a pitch, unleſs by aluring ſome <hi>Body of Proteſtants</hi> to go on blindfold with them in their <hi>deſign;</hi> and to that end they pitch'd upon the <hi>High Church Party,</hi> believing if they were practiſed in their <hi>Revenge</hi> upon the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> they would not much examine the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of what might be deſired by the <hi>Court.</hi> And accordingly this Traffick betwixt the <hi>King</hi> and that <hi>Party</hi> was firſt tranſacted in <hi>Parliament,</hi> where, for every <hi>Severe Law</hi> againſt the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> the Church Party gave the King either a Limb of our <hi>Liberties,</hi> or a good <hi>Additional Revenue,</hi> or a conſiderable <hi>Tax.</hi> And thus they drove a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Trade till the Deſign grew a little more <hi>bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fae'd,</hi> or ſome of that Party proved more <hi>honeſt</hi> than was expected, whereby it became impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to carry on the matter further in <hi>Parliament.</hi> And ſo at <hi>Oxford</hi> the King took his laſt <hi>Farewel</hi> of <hi>Parliaments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus ſhak'd hands with <hi>Parliaments,</hi> he then tryed what he could do by <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Terrors,</hi> turning out of all <hi>Commiſſions</hi> and <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments</hi> ſuch as would not comply, and <hi>filling up
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:58538:215"/>their rooms</hi> with Men of a <hi>contrary Complexion,</hi> thereby gratifying the <hi>Ambition</hi> of ſome and the <hi>Avarice</hi> of others, by reaſon of which there ſprang up a ſort of Men that were diſtinguiſhed by the Name of <hi>Tories,</hi> whoſe Principle it was to ſerve the King without <hi>asking a Queſtion;</hi> which is as much as to ſay, <hi>They were oblig'd to do every thing they were commanded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe were the Men that brought on <hi>Addreſſes, Loyal Tory Clubs,</hi> and <hi>Preſentments,</hi> and were the chief <hi>Promoters</hi> and <hi>Inſtruments</hi> in taking away <hi>Charters,</hi> which ſtruck at the very <hi>Heart</hi> of the <hi>Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I cannot but with amazement remember, how by their <hi>Addreſſes</hi> they courted the King to make them <hi>Slaves;</hi> and when they had a <hi>New Charter</hi> upon the ſurrender of the <hi>Old one,</hi> with what demonſtrations of Joy did they receive it, as if it had been their Glory to put on <hi>Chains,</hi> and at the ſame time reproaching every man as <hi>diſaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted</hi> to the <hi>Government,</hi> who would not conſent to give up the <hi>Rights</hi> of other <hi>People,</hi> or ſacrifice the Government.</p>
            <p>The ſurrender of <hi>Charters</hi> was quickly followed by <hi>Sham-plots</hi> againſt the <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> and to have the better effect of them, <hi>new Conſtructions of Law</hi> were invented, whereby many worthy <hi>Patriots</hi> fell.</p>
            <p>Whilſt theſe things were tranſacted, the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> were violently put in execution againſt the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> but the <hi>Papiſts</hi> went <hi>ſcot-free;</hi> nay, even thoſe very <hi>Laws</hi> that were made againſt them were turn'd upon the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and whenever there was any <hi>ſeeming Proſecution</hi> of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> it was only to have a <hi>freſh Pretence</hi> to fall upon the
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:58538:216"/>
               <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> for the <hi>Papiſts</hi> were by particular Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>ſlipt over.</hi> Thus the puſhing at <hi>Diſſenters</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Characteriſtick or Make of a <hi>true Son</hi> of the <hi>Church of England;</hi> for if a Man were violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bent againſt them, he was a good <hi>Son of the Church,</hi> though his <hi>Immorality</hi> and <hi>Debauchery</hi> had made him a <hi>Reproach</hi> to any <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After all this, the <hi>Clergy</hi> brought up the Rear, with their <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Divinity of Kings</hi> and <hi>Non-reſiſtance,</hi> thereby to give a <hi>Sanction</hi> to all the reſt, which reduced the matter into a very narrow compaſs, inferring from thence, that the <hi>King has as natural a Right to our Allegiance, as we have to the Obedience of our Children, and that under the pain of Damnation</hi> he was not to be diſobey'd.</p>
            <p>It's ſtrange, that <hi>Doctrines,</hi> the one ſo deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to the <hi>Right</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> and the other ſo <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent</hi> with the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi> ſhould obtain ſo much, had not the <hi>Higher Powers</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported its Credit; for that Patriarchal or real Right dethrones all the Kings on the Earth but one, and leaves the World at a loſs in the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Heir of <hi>Adam;</hi> for there can be but one at the ſame time that can claim as Heir to <hi>Adam,</hi> and conſequently all the reſt of the <hi>Kings</hi> are <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers:</hi> And here they are in a Wood themſelves, for they can no more tell you who is not the right Heir to <hi>Adam,</hi> than they know who is. Now, ſhould any one tell me, that my Eſtate was more conſiderable than I apprehended it to be, becauſe I might turn out all my Tenants that held by Lives or Years, but that withal it was Five hundred to one that ſome body elſe had a better Right to it than I have; perhaps I might thank him for his Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, but at the ſame time wiſh my Eſtate were
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:58538:216"/>leſs, and my Title to it better: Even as little are Kings beholden to them who perfwade them to quit the Title that the <hi>Government</hi> gives them to the <hi>Crown,</hi> to ſeek for a better, as claiming under <hi>Adam,</hi> whereby they may be more at liberty to act by their will; for if he thinks his beſt <hi>Title</hi> is by <hi>Deſcent,</hi> then it's poſſible that one of his <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> may have a better Right to the <hi>Crown</hi> than himſelf. As it fell out with <hi>William the Conqueror,</hi> when <hi>Edgar Ethling,</hi> who had a clearer Title by deſcent, ſwore Allegiance to him.</p>
            <p>As to the Doctrine of <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> and <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtance,</hi> there is nothing is ſo neat an Emblem of it as an <hi>Aſs,</hi> and nothing ſounds nearer to <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence;</hi> for if in any thing I have a <hi>Right,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive me of it either by <hi>Force</hi> or <hi>Fraud,</hi> muſt be confeſs'd to be a <hi>Wrong,</hi> and <hi>Wrong</hi> implies a <hi>Right</hi> to defend; and therefore the Law calls every man's <hi>Houſe</hi> his <hi>Caſtle,</hi> and his Goods his <hi>own:</hi> Nay, even <hi>bare Poſſeſſion</hi> is a good <hi>Title;</hi> but if I may not <hi>defend</hi> theſe, I have no Right to them, and if not in them, I have as little in my <hi>Perſon</hi> or <hi>Life.</hi> But I am perſwaded, that they who ſet this <hi>Doctrine</hi> on foot, at leaſt the greater number of them, who have been inſtrumental in propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it, either did not underſtand it, or elſe helped it forward in hopes of being <hi>well rewarded for their Pains;</hi> for it is found by Experience, that they underſtood the Practice of it very ill, for when the <hi>Biſhops</hi> were clapp'd up in the <hi>Tower,</hi> none cried out ſo much againſt King <hi>James,</hi> and arraign'd his <hi>Proceedings,</hi> ſo much as they that had been the greateſt <hi>Aſſerters</hi> of this <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="620" facs="tcp:58538:217"/>
            <p>But to make this a little plainer, I would only ask them this Queſtion, that is, <hi>What is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of our Allegiance or Obedience:</hi> for it is either the <hi>King's Will,</hi> or the <hi>Law;</hi> and the firſt point of <hi>Obedience</hi> is, to know the <hi>Will</hi> of the <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver;</hi> and therefore if they ſay it is the <hi>King's Will,</hi> I do preſume to anſwer, That cannot be the <hi>Meaſure</hi> of our <hi>Obedience,</hi> becauſe of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of it: and, 2ly, Becauſe he may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <hi>contrary things,</hi> which Rational Creatures cannot be bound to in point of their <hi>Obedience.</hi> If then they ſay it is the Law, then it will follow, that the <hi>Power</hi> of the King is <hi>limited,</hi> and when he exceeds the <hi>Limits,</hi> he aſſumes a <hi>Power</hi> which neither <hi>God, Nature,</hi> nor the <hi>Government</hi> inveſted him with; and therefore of right he may in ſuch Caſes be <hi>reſiſted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Point is very ſhort, either the King is <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited</hi> in his <hi>Power,</hi> or he is not, for there is no middle ſtate betwixt <hi>Slavery</hi> and <hi>Freedom:</hi> If the King is not limited, then are we as much under the <hi>Subjection</hi> of his <hi>Paſſions</hi> as his <hi>Reaſon;</hi> but if he is <hi>limited,</hi> then it is the <hi>Law</hi> that ſets him his Bounds, and the exerciſe of any <hi>Power,</hi> beyond what it allows him, is <hi>unlawful.</hi> Neither can it be ſuppos'd, that <hi>God</hi> would ſubject the World to the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Paſſions</hi> of particular Men, becauſe it is inconſiſtent with his <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Juſtice.</hi> The <hi>Will</hi> of a King is a wild uncertain thing, and a very falſe Guide to follow in <hi>governing</hi> his <hi>People;</hi> but to make the <hi>Law</hi> the Meaſure of all his <hi>Actions,</hi> and the <hi>Welfare</hi> of his <hi>People</hi> the end of all his <hi>Publick Deſigns,</hi> is that alone which will make a <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England ſafe, eaſie,</hi> and <hi>powerful.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="621" facs="tcp:58538:217"/>
            <p>There is one thing more that I would explain to you, and that is the difference betwixt the <hi>Government</hi> and the <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> of the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> for I am perſwaded that ſeveral People have been <hi>inſnared</hi> with the <hi>notion,</hi> that they were one and the ſame thing. I believe I need not tell you, that a <hi>Truſt</hi> and the <hi>execution of it</hi> are diſtinct things; and I may tell you, that the difference is no leſs betwixt the <hi>Government</hi> and the <hi>Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration</hi> of it; for if any thing be done that is not directed by that <hi>Truſt,</hi> it is the <hi>Act</hi> of thoſe that did it, and not of the <hi>Truſt.</hi> In like manner whatever is done that is not directed by the <hi>Law,</hi> it cannot be charged as a <hi>Fault</hi> upon the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> But in the two late Reigns every thing that was done, though never ſo unjuſt, unreaſonable, or without Preſident, was called the <hi>Government.</hi> Whereas the <hi>Government</hi> or <hi>Law</hi> (they are the ſame) is a known certain thing, not commanding one thing to day, and the contrary to morrow; it requires that <hi>equal right</hi> be done without reſpect to Perſons, and regards the <hi>Publick Good</hi> above any thing, and has ſo attemper'd <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> as to protect the <hi>Innocent,</hi> and puniſh the <hi>Guilty.</hi>

            <p>But I need not tell you how contrary to this was the <hi>Methods</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of the two late Reigns, to convince you, that all was <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Violence,</hi> and not the Government.</p>
            <p>Being thus encourag'd by the <hi>Addreſſes</hi> of the <hi>Tories</hi> and the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> went on at a good rate, eſpecially in the latter part of his Reign, and the Irregularities of thoſe times may well in a great meaſure be charg'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; for, it's poſſible that it had never come into King <hi>Charles</hi>'s Thoughts. But very probable,
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:58538:218"/>he had not adventur'd to carry matters ſo far, if he had not been ſo invited to it by them: And his Brother the Duke of <hi>York</hi> could not but ſmile in his Sleeve to ſee him ſo induſtrious in preparing his way to the <hi>Throne;</hi> for when King <hi>Charles</hi> died, he had carried the <hi>matter</hi> ſo far, that he could go no farther, unleſs he did downright declare himſelf a <hi>Papiſt;</hi> but whether he died a <hi>natural death,</hi> or had <hi>foul play,</hi> I will leave that to be determin'd by every man in his own Thoughts; only thus much I muſt obſerve, that manifeſt Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes of <hi>Poyſon</hi> appeared on his <hi>Body,</hi> and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were then ſo <hi>laid,</hi> that it was neceſſary to have a <hi>Popiſh Prince</hi> on the <hi>Throne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Eyes being clos'd, the Duke preſently ſhew'd how great an <hi>Affection</hi> he had for his <hi>Brother,</hi> not only in the great haſte he made to <hi>interr</hi> him, but alſo by the reſt of the <hi>Treatment</hi> he gave his <hi>Body;</hi> for if you had the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of it, you would ſay they gave him the <hi>Burial of an Aſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now his <hi>Brother</hi> being got into his place, he quickly pulled off the <hi>Vizard,</hi> for he had not the diſcretion to <hi>diſſemble the matter</hi> for a ſhort time, but out of the depth of his <hi>Politicks</hi> in a few days went publickly to <hi>Maſs, Fools</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always more <hi>poſitive</hi> than men of <hi>better ſence,</hi> and <hi>Cowards</hi> moſt inſolent when they have the <hi>upper hand;</hi> for he thought he had the <hi>Nation</hi> in a <hi>String.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though this was very plain above board, yet the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Tories</hi> ſo little regarded it, that with great <hi>Zeal</hi> they addreſs'd to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate his <hi>acceſſion to the Throne,</hi> as if <hi>God in mercy had taken away his Brother to make room for him.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="623" facs="tcp:58538:218"/>
            <p>He had no ſooner thus publickly made profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Romiſh Faith,</hi> but <hi>Maſs</hi> was ſaid open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in other places, and in a ſhort time <hi>Popiſh Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels</hi> were erected in ſeveral parts of the <hi>Kingdom.</hi> To this he added a great <hi>Army,</hi> who lived in a manner upon <hi>Free Quarter,</hi> committing all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of other <hi>Inſolencies,</hi> and no <hi>Redreſs</hi> could be had upon any <hi>Complaint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all this did not abate the <hi>Loyalty</hi> of the <hi>Tories</hi> and <hi>Clergy,</hi> till after the defeat of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> upon which he not only put in <hi>Popiſh Officers,</hi> but told the <hi>Parliament</hi> to their <hi>Face,</hi> that he had ſo done, and was reſolv'd to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed:</hi> and he was as good as his word, for he made <hi>Popiſh Officers Juſtices of the Peace,</hi> and <hi>Judges,</hi> upon which <hi>Loyalty</hi> began to decline, for they fell away from him every day more than other. But he ſtopp'd not here, for that he might diſoblige the <hi>Tories</hi> and <hi>Clergy,</hi> as well as he had the reſt of the <hi>Nation,</hi> the <hi>Papiſts</hi> excepted: he ſet up the <hi>High Commiſſion,</hi> and then the <hi>Declaration of Indulgence,</hi> and for refuſing to comply with it, he clapp'd up ſeven of the <hi>Biſhops</hi> in the <hi>Tower.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am far from detracting from the Praiſe that is due to that <hi>Action</hi> of the Biſhops, yet give me leave to ſay, the <hi>Merit</hi> of it is not ſo great as many have cry'd it up to be, for they refuſed to read the <hi>Declaration</hi> more out of <hi>Self-Intereſt</hi> than out of regard to the <hi>Publick,</hi> otherwiſe why did they not <hi>refuſe</hi> to read <hi>the Declaration</hi> of <hi>Charles</hi> II. upon his <hi>diſſolving</hi> the <hi>Oxford Parliament,</hi> which ſtruck more directly at the <hi>Heart</hi> of the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> than King <hi>James</hi> did, yet not one Biſhop <hi>refuſed it,</hi> and accounted every one diſaffected to the <hi>Government</hi> that did <hi>diſlike</hi> it. And that which further prevails with me to be of this Opinion, is,
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:58538:219"/>becauſe ſome of theſe <hi>Biſhops,</hi> at this time, refuſe to take the <hi>Oaths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would be endleſs to run through all the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of King <hi>James</hi>'s <hi>Exorbitant Reign,</hi> but in ſhort, he had turn'd the <hi>Government</hi> on its <hi>Head,</hi> and was reſolv'd to ſet up <hi>Popery,</hi> inſtead of <hi>God's true Worſhip,</hi> and his <hi>Abſolute Will and Pleaſure</hi> in the room of the <hi>Law,</hi> and had fully accompliſh'd his purpoſe, if <hi>God</hi> had not ſent us a <hi>Deliverer,</hi> by whoſe aſſiſtance we thruſt him from the <hi>Throne.</hi> For having broke his <hi>Coronation-Oath,</hi> and the Condition upon which he receiv'd the <hi>Crown,</hi> he thereby loſt all the Right of <hi>ſwaying this Scepter.</hi> And by a juſt and real <hi>Authority,</hi> with which the People of <hi>England</hi> are inveſted upon ſuch occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, has the <hi>Nation,</hi> by a full and free <hi>Conſent,</hi> placed King <hi>William</hi> on the <hi>Throne,</hi> who, I truſt, will be the <hi>Repairer</hi> of our <hi>Breaches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How then ought we to <hi>rejoyce?</hi> what cauſe have we to be thankful for ſuch a <hi>ſtupendious Change,</hi> when we had nothing but a fearful look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-for of <hi>utter Ruine?</hi> we now enjoy the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion</hi> inſtead of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and a <hi>juſt and equal Government</hi> inſtead of <hi>Slavery;</hi> and all this brought about without the expence of Blood.</p>
            <p>So that I ſtand amaz'd when I hear of any that are for recalling the late King <hi>James;</hi> if there be any ſuch, I hope I ſhall not be accounted <hi>ſevere</hi> if I wiſh they were with him, for I think it would be beſt and ſafeſt for <hi>them</hi> and <hi>every body elſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Can any Man be ſo ſenceleſs as to deſire to ſet <hi>that man</hi> over them again, who had once deſtroy'd their <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi> and had juſtly <hi>forfeited</hi> his <hi>Crown</hi> by <hi>Male Adminiſtration;</hi> for when the
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:58538:219"/>
               <hi>King</hi> denies his <hi>Protection,</hi> the <hi>People are diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged</hi> of their <hi>Obedience</hi> to him, becauſe the <hi>Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of <hi>Protection</hi> and <hi>Subjection</hi> is reciprocal. Nay, I may preſume to ſay, that the <hi>People</hi> have a <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Right</hi> to be well govern'd than any King can have to his <hi>Crown;</hi> for their Right of being <hi>well govern'd</hi> was firſt in <hi>Nature,</hi> and ſecondly, it is <hi>neceſſary</hi> to the <hi>being</hi> of <hi>Mankind;</hi> but ſo is it not that this or the other man be on the <hi>Throne,</hi> nor even the <hi>form</hi> of the <hi>Government</hi> it ſelf, for that ſort of <hi>Government</hi> is moſt neceſſary that is beſt for the <hi>Common Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We now fit ſafely under our <hi>Vines</hi> and <hi>Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees,</hi> and every man may <hi>Worſhip God</hi> without being <hi>hawled</hi> to a <hi>Goal,</hi> the <hi>Bone</hi> is taken away that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> uſed to <hi>throw</hi> amongſt <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to ſet them together by the <hi>Ears.</hi> And truly, it was always my <hi>Opinion,</hi> that it would never go well with <hi>England</hi> till every man might <hi>worſhip</hi> God in his own way. And this being thus <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily accompliſh'd,</hi> I do beg your permiſſion to offer my <hi>Advice,</hi> which is this.</p>
            <p>That all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> would now <hi>unite</hi> againſt the <hi>Common Enemy,</hi> and forbear all <hi>Diſtinctions</hi> and <hi>Revilings,</hi> though we may <hi>differ</hi> in ſome things, yet let us neither <hi>reproach</hi> him that goes to his <hi>Pariſh Church,</hi> nor be <hi>ſcandaliz'd</hi> at him that goes to a <hi>Barn:</hi> let no man be offended at a <hi>Liturgy,</hi> or <hi>ſet Form of Prayer,</hi> nor think <hi>extempore Prayer</hi> is unacceptable to God; every <hi>Tub</hi> muſt ſtand on its own <hi>bottom,</hi> therefore let every man be more careful to <hi>mind</hi> and <hi>mend</hi> his <hi>own Failings,</hi> than to obſerve the <hi>Faults</hi> of others: let every man live up to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> he profeſſes, and ſincerely act according to his <hi>Principles,</hi> and prefer the <hi>publick</hi>
               <pb n="626" facs="tcp:58538:220"/>before any <hi>private Intereſt,</hi> and then it will go well with them <hi>here</hi> and <hi>hereafter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have I given you my <hi>ſcatter'd Thoughts,</hi> which I have endeavour'd to put together as well as I could with the <hi>ſhort leiſure</hi> I have had.</p>
            <p>As to the particular <hi>Buſineſs</hi> of this day, it would be needleſs to offer you any <hi>Directions,</hi> your <hi>Oath</hi> has ſufficiently inſtructed you, and I ſuppoſe moſt, if not all of you, underſtand your <hi>Duty</hi> as well as I can <hi>inform</hi> you; therefore I will only ſay, that whatever is an <hi>Offence</hi> againſt the <hi>Law</hi> is <hi>preſentable</hi> by you.</p>
            <p>Your Country has repoſed a great and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Truſt in you, and I don't doubt your <hi>good and faithful diſcharge</hi> of it; only this I deſire to recommend to you, That you will not find any <hi>Indictment</hi> or <hi>Preſentment</hi> upon Suſpicious or ſlight Evidence; for it is <hi>unjuſt, unreaſonable,</hi> and may be of <hi>fatal conſequence</hi> to <hi>our ſelves</hi> or our <hi>Poſterity.</hi> A Man's Reputation is a precious thing, and no man ought to be troubled unneceſſarily: And I do rather give you this <hi>Caution,</hi> becauſe it was the Practice of the <hi>Late Times,</hi> and I hope we ſhall rather <hi>reform</hi> their <hi>Practices</hi> than follow them, and come nearer to the Golden Rule, of <hi>doing as we would be done by.</hi> But in ſaying this I don't de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to lead you out of the way of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> that any who have <hi>offended the Law</hi> ſhould eſcape <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</hi> Let the Guilty receive the <hi>Reward</hi> of their <hi>Doings,</hi> and the <hi>Innocent</hi> ſuffer no <hi>Wrong,</hi> and then ſhall we be a happy People.</p>
            <p>So I will trouble you no further, but to pray God to direct you in your <hi>Buſineſs.</hi>

            <p>I have heard it poſitively affirm'd, That 80, &amp; 81. is become 40, &amp; 41. That the ſame Game is now <hi>playing</hi> that was then.</p>
            <pb n="628" facs="tcp:58538:221"/>
            <p>If by this is meant, That our <hi>old and reſtleſs Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> the Papiſts are now at <hi>work;</hi> that it is <hi>they</hi> who at this time are labouring our <hi>Deſtruction;</hi> and that they are the <hi>Danger</hi> that threatens us, I fully agree with every man who is of that <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;</hi> but if by this Aſſertion any would inſinuate that there is a Plot againſt the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> carried on by all or any of the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> beſides that Plot of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> I cannot ſubſcribe to it, becauſe where <hi>God Almighty</hi> permits me to uſe my <hi>Reaſon,</hi> I cannot believe, but upon clear evidence, and I have not met with any thing that can warrant ſuch an <hi>Opinion;</hi> and therefore in things of this or the like nature we ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain our ſelves very clearly, leſt by leaving the <hi>matter</hi> under a <hi>doubtful conſtruction,</hi> we may (againſt our intention) caſt an <hi>Imputation</hi> upon them who do not deſerve it.</p>
            <p>I am apt to believe, that he who is moſt ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſt with the <hi>Opinion,</hi> That the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> have formed a Plot againſt the King and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will not adventure to juſtifie it before His Majeſty and a Parliament, and certainly that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which will not abide the Teſt of the King and Parliament, is not much to be valued: But he who believes that there is a <hi>Popiſh Plot,</hi> for the taking away of His Majeſty's Life, (which God long preſerve) and the altering of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> may avow his <hi>Opinion</hi> to all the World, becauſe he has an undeniable Authority for it, for His Majeſty in Parliament, and both Houſes, have declared no leſs: but we do not find that <hi>His Majeſty,</hi> or either Houſe of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> has made any Declaration, that they have ſo much as in ſuſpicion any other ſort of People
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:58538:221"/>who are deſigning againſt his <hi>Life</hi> and the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think it is agreed by all, that this <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is the beſt in the World, for it gives the King a <hi>Prerogative,</hi> whereby he may appear great both at <hi>home</hi> and <hi>abroad;</hi> and it gives the <hi>Subject</hi> ſuch a <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Property</hi> in his <hi>Perſon</hi> and <hi>Goods,</hi> that he cannot be deprived of either, without his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, unleſs for the breach of ſome <hi>known Law:</hi> and beſides, <hi>Prerogative</hi> and <hi>Property</hi> help and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port each other; that is, when they are rightly underſtood and applied; for the Intereſt of <hi>King and People</hi> are as inſeparable as the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Light,</hi> but when <hi>Prerogative</hi> and <hi>Property</hi> ſtand at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, it is occaſioned either by overgrown Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, who by their <hi>Counſels</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> have render'd themſelves obnoxious to the <hi>publick,</hi> and therefore ſo ſhroud themſelves from Juſtice, adviſe the <hi>King</hi> to inſiſt upon ſomething as his Prerogative, which tends rather to hurt than pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his juſt Prerogative; or elſe from ſome am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious <hi>reſtleſs Spirits,</hi> who burr into the People, that this or that is their <hi>Property,</hi> which in the end will make their <hi>Juſt Rights</hi> to be <hi>Felo de ſe.</hi> And, what cares the one or other of theſe <hi>Make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates,</hi> for they are for the moſt part men of <hi>deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Fortunes,</hi> who having little or nothing to <hi>loſe,</hi> cannot doubt to reap advantage by the publick di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance?</p>
            <p>But to avoid the Evil on either Hand, I think it would be a very good Rule to conſider how far what is inſiſted on does quadrate with the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Good,</hi> and if they find that it does not agree to that Rule, then to let it go as a thing that is againſt their <hi>true Intereſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="630" facs="tcp:58538:222"/>
            <p>It is agreed on all ſides, that there is a <hi>Plot</hi> for to <hi>Murther His Majeſty,</hi> and to alter the <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> but whence our <hi>danger</hi> does ariſe, who is the <hi>Common Enemy,</hi> and againſt whom we are to <hi>unite,</hi> is that which makes the Diſpute and Diviſions amongſt us.</p>
            <p>I take it to be an undeniable Truth, That eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>State</hi> or <hi>Kingdom</hi> muſt expect to receive the moſt frequent and greateſt Affronts and Injuries from ſuch of their <hi>Neighbours,</hi> whoſe <hi>Support</hi> and <hi>Intereſt</hi> does leaſt depend upon them: And every Government muſt, in reaſon, expect its Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances and Diſquiets from ſuch <hi>Subjects,</hi> whoſe <hi>Intereſt</hi> does leaſt depend upon the preſervation of the Government: And though I will not haſtily judge <hi>any Man,</hi> yet when there is a Plot <hi>againſt</hi> the <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Goverument,</hi> they are with moſt reaſon to be under the <hi>ſuſpicion</hi> of it, who are of a contrary <hi>Religion,</hi> and acknowledge a <hi>foreign Juriſdiction,</hi> until there is very good Proof to charge it upon ſome other People.</p>
            <p>I am verily perſwaded, that there are ſeveral Papiſts in <hi>England,</hi> whoſe <hi>Quietneſs of Temper</hi> may make them very averſe to give the Nation any <hi>diſturbance,</hi> and I heartily wiſh they were all ſuch. But when I conſider the greater number of them, and the <hi>Slavery</hi> they are under to their <hi>Prieſts,</hi> I muſt be under an apprehenſion that they cannot intend us any <hi>good,</hi> becauſe their <hi>Religion</hi> is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite to ours, and they look upon themſelves as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der another Juriſdiction: but I know that not many years ſince Popery was a thing of a remote conſideration, and that they who declared their Fears of it were (by thoſe who called themſelves the <hi>King's Friends</hi>) accounted <hi>Enemies to the King,
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:58538:222"/>and ill-affected to the Government:</hi> Yet ſince the diſcovery of the Plot has proved their <hi>Fears</hi> were not groundleſs, I ſuppoſe it is no difficult point to determine who are to be blamed, they who were afraid of Popery, or they who reprehended them ſo ſeverely for their <hi>Fears:</hi> for the Proof of the preſent <hi>Conſpiracy</hi> of the Papiſts is ſo <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> that there remains no room for a Doubt, <hi>whether there is ſuch a</hi> Plot, <hi>or no.</hi> And, who is not confirmed in this <hi>Opinion,</hi> ſince His Majeſty and both Houſes of Parliament have declared,</p>
            <p>That <hi>there has been, and ſtill is, a damnable and belliſh Conſpiracy, contrived and carried on by the</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh <hi>Recuſants, for the aſſaſſinating and murthering the King, for ſubverting the Government, and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the</hi> Proteſtant Religion <hi>now by Law eſtabliſh'd?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, can any Man be ſo hardy, as to think, that <hi>His Majeſty</hi> would lay ſo ſevere an Imputation upon a great part of his <hi>Subjects,</hi> (for, God knows, they are too many who are of that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion) or that the Parliament would paſs ſo great a <hi>Cenſure</hi> upon ſuch a number of their <hi>Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Subjects,</hi> without plain and evident <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> and ſuch as muſt convince <hi>every man</hi> but he who will not believe, for by this Declaration they have avowed their <hi>Opinion</hi> to the whole <hi>World.</hi> And there is one thing which further confirms me in the belief of a Popiſh Plot, becauſe in ſome of the <hi>Evidence</hi> it is declared, That <hi>the</hi> Papiſts <hi>never had ſuch hopes of reſtoring their Religion ſince Q.</hi> Maries <hi>days, as at this time;</hi> for it ſeems they had prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red every thing to their <hi>Hearts deſire,</hi> if His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty were but <hi>out of the way;</hi> and how near they have been to effect it, is horrible to remember;
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:58538:223"/>and it's a wonder they have not done it, ſince they have not ſtuck at any thing whereby they might <hi>attain</hi> it: And if we alſo conſider how many fair Opportunities they have had, we may conclude, that <hi>God Almighty</hi> has wonderfully <hi>preſerved him,</hi> and may he always have him in his <hi>keeping.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding all this, ſome do take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them to ſay, That <hi>there is no</hi> Popiſh, <hi>but a</hi> Presbyterian Plot; I doubt there are too many who account it <hi>Loyalty</hi> to oppoſe every thing that the late Parliaments have done, and though there be never ſo much <hi>Reaſon</hi> in the thing, yet if the Parliament had a hand in it, it is a ſufficient ground to them to <hi>traduce</hi> it. But though they are reſolved to think <hi>amiſs</hi> of what the Parliament has done, yet in the point of the Popiſh Plot they may allow the Parliament to be in the right, ſince <hi>His Majeſty</hi> is of the ſame opinion, for he that ſhall oppoſe his <hi>Judgment</hi> againſt the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of King and Parliament, muſt needs tax them with a great deal of <hi>raſhneſs</hi> and <hi>haſte</hi> in their Declaration, or elſe profeſs himſelf to be a Man of a very extraordinary <hi>Underſtanding</hi> and <hi>Obſervation,</hi> that can ſee further into the matter than the King and Parliament. If there be any man that is acquainted with this <hi>Myſtery</hi> that is hid from the Eyes of King and Parliament, it is, no doubt, a Duty incumbent upon him to reveal the <hi>Secret</hi> to his <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Country,</hi> that they may no longer continue to harbour an <hi>ill Opinion</hi> of them who are not blame worthy.</p>
            <p>He that can believe that there is no <hi>Popiſh</hi> but a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Plot, muſt alſo believe, that both the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have now changed their former <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Practices.</hi>

            <p>The Principles of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are incomparably laid open by the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> by which every man may ſee how <hi>dangerous</hi> and <hi>deſtructive</hi> they are to all <hi>Civil Governments.</hi> And the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holds it to be <hi>lawful</hi> to promote their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi> by any way or means, though never ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the <hi>Word of God</hi> and <hi>Common Morality</hi> or <hi>Honeſty.</hi> Accordingly it has been their Practice, which produced the <hi>Pariſian Maſſacre,</hi> where ſo many <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were <hi>barbarouſly murdered</hi> in one night.

<pb n="634" facs="tcp:58538:224"/>and beſides, it is an undervaluing of the <hi>Almighty Power of God,</hi> as if he ſtood in need of ſuch aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to eſtabliſh his <hi>Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are not of ſuch <hi>Principles,</hi> they are willing to aſſiſt the <hi>Government</hi> againſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> for they have no other <hi>Intereſt,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I cannot believe them to be like the <hi>fooliſh Woman,</hi> that pulls down her Houſe with her Hands: And if we ſhould believe, that their <hi>Principles</hi> enclined them to practiſe againſt the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> I doubt it would caſt a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon that which we would be loth to hear <hi>ill ſpoken of;</hi> for as they differ from us only in ſome <hi>Indifferent Ceremonies,</hi> but agree with us in <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> therefore their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi> is the ſame, and accordingly will their <hi>Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations</hi> carry them. Their <hi>Practice</hi> proves them to be true to their <hi>King,</hi> and firm to the <hi>Government,</hi> for when the <hi>Popiſh Subjects</hi> have rebelled againſt their <hi>King,</hi> they have always ſtuck to their <hi>Prince,</hi> and that too in <hi>Popiſh Countries:</hi> Examples here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there are very many, and the preſent <hi>French King</hi> on this ſcore owes a great deal to them of the <hi>Reformed Religion;</hi> for when his <hi>Popiſh Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> rebelled, and would have ſet up another in his <hi>room,</hi> they <hi>ſtuck</hi> to him, and <hi>ſetled</hi> him in the <hi>Throne.</hi> It was the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> who were chiefly inſtrumental in his <hi>Majeſty's Reſtauration,</hi> whilſt others, who called themſelves <hi>The Royal Party,</hi> ſate ſtill to ſee the <hi>Game</hi> play'd, and when they ſaw which way the <hi>Scales</hi> would turn, were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to applaud the <hi>Victor,</hi> let it fall to which ſide it would: And <hi>His Majeſty</hi> was ſo ſenſible that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> were chiefly inſtrumental in that <hi>Work,</hi> that he declared himſelf in favour of them in theſe words:</p>

            <p>This is not ſo very long ſince, that it can in probability be imagined that they ſhould now be ſo clean altered to the contrary, as to practiſe againſt the King and Government.</p>
            <p>I don't wonder that there is a noiſe of a <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi> Plot, but it is ſome cauſe of admiration to me, that ſo many ſeem to believe it.</p>
            <p>I can't tell what <hi>Information</hi> others may have met with, whereby they are prevailed upon to believe it, but all that I can underſtand, that has given ground for ſuch a <hi>Suſpicion,</hi> is, the <hi>Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> againſt <hi>Colledge</hi> and my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> which methinks is too <hi>ſlender a proof</hi> to charge ſo many Thouſands with a <hi>Conſpiracy</hi> againſt the King and Government: for in the Tryals both of <hi>Colledge</hi> and my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> it was not ſo much as attempted to prove a Plot <hi>in general;</hi> though at <hi>Colledge</hi>'s <hi>Tryal</hi> it was urged, That that Method would be the <hi>more regular proceeding;</hi> but in both the <hi>Tryals</hi> the Evidence was levell'd againſt them chiefly, without fetching in ſuch numbers as are neceſſary to make it a Plot of the <hi>Presbyterians.</hi> I ſhall not ſay any thing, whether the Evidence againſt <hi>both</hi> or <hi>either</hi> ſwore true, or not, nor of the
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:58538:225"/>
               <hi>Improbabilities</hi> of ſome of them, but this, I think, I may ſay, That the things chiefly inſiſted on againſt either of them, were only <hi>Indiſcretions</hi> committed by them: ſurely then it will be very <hi>ſevere,</hi> to charge ſo great a part of the <hi>Nation</hi> with a Plot, becauſe my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> and <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> had <hi>overſhot themſelves,</hi> if all were true that was <hi>ſworn</hi> againſt them.</p>
            <p>It is no new thing for the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to put <hi>Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plots</hi> upon others, and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> are never nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to execute a Plot of their own, than when there is the moſt <hi>noiſe</hi> and <hi>buſtle</hi> about ſome other People; for nothing can give them ſo great <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> and <hi>Certinty</hi> to execute any Plot or Deſign, as when they amuſe the Government with the <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Danger</hi> of <hi>other People;</hi> and accordingly have they acted all-along: The <hi>Pariſian Maſſacre</hi> was performed with the greater Certainty, by pretending that the <hi>Hugonots</hi> had <hi>a deſign to ſeize the King.</hi> In all the Attempts that were made upon Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> if any of them had taken effect, it was to have been charged upon the <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans,</hi> as they were called.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Gun-powder Plot,</hi> if it had ſucceeded, the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were to have born the <hi>odium</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>And if their <hi>preſent Conſpiracy</hi> had not been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by an <hi>opportune diſcovery,</hi> it muſt have been caſt upon the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and thence the Papiſts would have taken occaſion to <hi>murder Thouſands of Proteſtants.</hi> And though they were <hi>defeated</hi> at that time, yet they quickly after <hi>attempted</hi> it again in Mrs. <hi>Celier</hi>'s <hi>Meal-tub Plot;</hi> and though that had no better <hi>ſucceſs</hi> than the former, yet I hope it is no breach of Charity to conclude, that this noiſe of a <hi>Presbyterian Plot</hi> is a <hi>Contrivance</hi> of the
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:58538:225"/>
               <hi>Papiſts,</hi> to cover their own <hi>Bloody Deſign</hi> till they have put it in execution.</p>
            <p>It is a Plot of a large extent, and what the <hi>Reformed</hi> in <hi>France</hi> endure at preſent is an Effect of it; and the reaſon why they are not quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd, is, becauſe the Work is not done here; but if they could ever carry their <hi>Buſineſs here,</hi> not only the Proteſtants in this <hi>King's Dominions,</hi> and thoſe in <hi>France,</hi> but all the Proteſtants in <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> muſt undergo the utmoſt Cruelties that <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> can invent.</p>
            <p>And ſince nothing will ſuffice but our <hi>utter De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,</hi> if they get the <hi>upper hand,</hi> it is high time to <hi>unite</hi> our ſelves, to oppoſe ſo dreadful an <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</hi> And, for my part, I do believe that I ſhould incut the Cenſure of a <hi>Mad-man,</hi> if my Houſe were beſet by People who had reſolved, if they could get in, to ſpoil my Goods, and cut the Throats of me and my <hi>Family,</hi> if ſome of my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants had offended me, I ſhould chuſe rather at that time to correct them for their <hi>Offence,</hi> than to paſs by their <hi>Fault,</hi> and encourage them to aſſiſt me againſt thoſe who were <hi>attempting</hi> to break into my Houſe. And, in my opinion, there is the ſame reaſon to be at this time a little ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (ſo far as by <hi>Law</hi> we can) towards thoſe who differ from us only in <hi>Circumſtantials,</hi> till the Common Enemy is ſubdued, and then we may with greater <hi>Safety</hi> and <hi>Security</hi> uſe proper ways to make them more conformable.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs that I am not very inclinable to perſecute People barely on the ſcore of Religion, and I think <hi>His Majeſty</hi> has declared himſelf to the ſame purpoſe; and till the diſcovery of the Plot, there was no man who found leſs fault with
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:58538:226"/>the Papiſts than I did; but by it I am convinc'd, that no Peace is to be had with them who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any provocation (for they were tenderly uſed) ſhould <hi>frame</hi> and be ready to <hi>execute</hi> ſo <hi>black a Deſign,</hi> as not to leave one Proteſtant alive.</p>
            <p>Therefore if the danger to the <hi>King,</hi> our <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> does not ariſe from the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> I cannot imagine what elſe we need to fear, but every man may ſit ſafely under his <hi>Vine</hi> and <hi>Fig-tree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am very ſenſible, that there are ſome who watch my <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> very narrowly, and from this preſent <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> will take occaſion to call me <hi>Fanatick</hi> or <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> or if they could think of any term of greater <hi>Reproach,</hi> would not ſtick to lay it upon me: but ſuch <hi>Revilings</hi> don't diſturb me, for the Miſchief they deſign to me by it will fall upon their own <hi>Pates,</hi> for their <hi>Accuſations</hi> are <hi>falſe;</hi> they cannot charge me with the <hi>wilful breach</hi> of any <hi>Law,</hi> or in what Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular I don't <hi>conform</hi> to the <hi>Church;</hi> I am ſure they cannot convict me of any enormous Crime; if any day be appointed by the <hi>Government,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for <hi>Faſting</hi> or <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> they cannot ſay that I failed in my <hi>Duty;</hi> they cannot ſay, that upon the 30th of <hi>January,</hi> or any other day of <hi>Humiliation,</hi> that at night, when I ſhould have been in my Bed, or elſe in my Cloſet; to <hi>lament</hi> the Sins of the <hi>Nation,</hi> and to bewail my own <hi>Offences,</hi> that either at my own Houſe, or any adjacent <hi>Alehouſe,</hi> I ſate drinking and tippling till three or four a clock in the morning, till I had made my ſelf and the reſt of the Company drunk.</p>
            <pb n="639" facs="tcp:58538:226"/>
            <p>If any man be guilty of ſuch things, he highly deſerves the <hi>Severeſt Puniſhment</hi> that can be inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him, for this is ſuch grand <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> and ſo plain a bidding of <hi>defiance to God,</hi> that they are dangerous to any <hi>Civil Society:</hi> Such People as theſe, who faſt only to prepare their Bodies for the <hi>Nights debauch,</hi> are the Informers upon <hi>Penal Statutes,</hi> who, to gain ſomething to themſelves, put their Neighbours to a treble charge; theſe make no <hi>Conſcience</hi> of an <hi>Oath,</hi> and are inclinable rather to ſwear too much than too little; yes, neglect their manifeſt <hi>Duty to God,</hi> that they may be able to accuſe their <hi>Neighbours</hi> of a ſmaller <hi>Offence.</hi> Men of ſuch Principles and Practiſes as theſe, are they who beget an <hi>ill underſtanding</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the King and his People, by Informations and Suggeſtions, which if they were but made publick, they would be aſhamed to own; by theſe they endeavour to create in His Majeſty a diſlike of others who are better than themſelves in every reſpect; and hence it occaſions, that our <hi>domeſtick affairs</hi> are pry'd into: I will not take upon me to ſay how <hi>legal</hi> theſe things are, or how far theſe Proceedings are <hi>warranted by Law,</hi> but I will leave it to every man to conſider, whether he is not ſafer any where than at his own Houſe; whether his Table may not become a <hi>Snare</hi> to him, and his own Servants ſhall be the means to cut his <hi>Throat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if Informers would acquaint themſelves with the <hi>Laws</hi> concerning <hi>Informations</hi> and <hi>Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions,</hi> they would not be ſo haſty in accuſing others, for the <hi>Law</hi> does not ſeem to favour them at all, but rather diſcourages ſuch Proceedings, for it gives the Party injur'd very good Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:58538:227"/>and ſeverely puniſhes the Informer, if his <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation</hi> prove <hi>falſe:</hi> as you will find by theſe Statutes.</p>
            <p>5 <hi>Ed.</hi> III. 9.

            <p>38 <hi>Ed.</hi> III. 9. As to the Article made at the laſt Parliament, of thoſe that make grievous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints to the King himſelf, it is aſſented, <hi>That if he that maketh the Complaint cannot prove his Intent againſt the Defendant, by proceſs limited in the ſame Article, he ſhall be commanded to Priſon, there to

And the point contained in the ſame Article, That the Plaintiff ſhall incur the ſame pain which the other ſhould have if he were attainted, ſhall be out, in caſe that his Suggeſtion be found untrue.</hi>

At the Requeſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, by their Petitions put forth in this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to eſchew the Miſchiefs and Damage done to divers of his Commons by falſe Accuſers, which oftentimes have made their Accuſations more for Revenge and ſingular Benefit, than for the Profit of the King or his People; which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed Perſons ſome have been taken, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cauſed to come before the King's Council by Writ, and otherwiſe upon grievous Pain againſt the Law: <hi>It is aſſented and accorded, for the good governance of the Commons, that no man be put to anſwer without Preſentments before Juſtices, or Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Record, or by due Proceſs and Writ original, according to the old Law of the Land: And if any thing from henceforth be done to the contrary, it ſhall be void in the Law, and holden for Error.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the ſame purpoſe are the Statutes of 17 <hi>Rich.</hi> II. 6. 15 <hi>Hen.</hi> VI. 4. which you may peruſe at your leiſure; and becauſe I will not trouble you too long, I will ſay no more of them, but leave every man to make his own Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the whole matter, and ſo I'll proceed to the Particulars of your <hi>Charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="642" facs="tcp:58538:228"/>
            <p>But Gentlemen, if we invite our Friends to <hi>Dinner,</hi> and the Gates and Doors are left open for all perſons that pleaſe to come in and partake of what the <hi>Cellar</hi> and <hi>Kitchin</hi> will afford, and no <hi>Violence</hi> or <hi>Rudeneſs</hi> is offer'd to any perſon, this is not a <hi>Riot</hi> within the meaning of the <hi>Law;</hi> and if any ſuch thing ſhall be offer'd to your <hi>conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> I hope you will not take it to be your <hi>Duty</hi> to <hi>preſent</hi> it.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, one thing more I will mention, and then I will diſmiſs you: There is a new Opinion which obtains very much, which is this, <hi>That a Grand Jury is oblig'd to find every Indictment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſidering the Credibility of Perſons that ſwear to it, and the probability of what they ſwear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, I do not underſtand the reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableneſs of this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> for by this Rule a man has more play for any thing elſe than his <hi>Life:</hi> Firſt, As to his <hi>Eſtate,</hi> he has Relief three ſeveral ways, firſt, at <hi>Common Law;</hi> ſecondly, in <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery;</hi> and thirdly, in <hi>Parliament.</hi> As to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, though he may be injured by a <hi>falſe Verdict,</hi> yet by an Arreſt of <hi>Judgment</hi> he may have another Hearing, or elſe in proceſs of time he may come to redeem his Credit ſome other way; but when an <hi>Indictment</hi> is preferred againſt a Man for his Life, and the Grand Jury are oblig'd to Find the <hi>Bill,</hi> if it be <hi>Sworn</hi> to, then that man has but one play for his <hi>Life,</hi> and if the Petty Jury give a falſe Verdict, there's an end of him, for there is no redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption from the Grave.</p>
            <pb n="643" facs="tcp:58538:228"/>
            <p>But beſides, if you are obliged of courſe to Find every <hi>Bill,</hi> if it be ſworn to, and may not conſider and deliberate upon the <hi>Evidence</hi> before you, not only a great many will be put to cauſeleſs Trouble and unneceſſary Charge, but it will be an <hi>undervaluing</hi> of your Service, and a <hi>leſſening</hi> of the Truſt that your Country repoſes in you. It is a new Doctrine, and therefore it is not convenient to be too forward to put it into practiſe, till time ſhall prove that it is agreeeble to the <hi>Fundamentals of the Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> I will detain you no longer, but do pray <hi>GOD</hi> to direct you in your <hi>Buſineſs.</hi>

                  <p>Now, that ſort of Government appears to be moſt proper and agreeable to <hi>Mankind,</hi> where the power and adminiſtration of the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi> is veſted or ſetled in one <hi>ſingle perſon.</hi> And this is fully cleared by the courſe of <hi>Experience</hi> ever ſince the World began, although ſome Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are not ſo happy as to enjoy this <hi>Bleſſing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> that Government which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a <hi>ſingle perſon</hi> (I mean a <hi>King</hi>) is more or leſs happy for the People, according as it depends more upon the <hi>King's Will,</hi> and ſo conſequently leſs upon the <hi>Laws;</hi> or elſe more upon the <hi>Laws,</hi>
                     <pb n="647" facs="tcp:58538:230"/>and leſs upon the <hi>Pleaſure of the King:</hi> And this is the difference betwixt us and our <hi>neighbouring Nations;</hi> our Government depends upon the <hi>Laws,</hi> but theirs chiefly, or for the moſt part, upon the <hi>Will and Pleaſure of their Kings:</hi> and though no Government under the Sun be perfect in every point, yet I think I may ſafely affirm, that ours is perfect, in compariſon of any other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the World; for if we conſider thoſe <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> that have Parliaments, that <hi>Aſſembly</hi> is of little or no uſe to the People, but to paſs into <hi>Laws</hi> the <hi>Edicts</hi> of their King.</p>
                  <p>But God be praiſed, our Parliament is of far greater <hi>uſe</hi> and <hi>advantage</hi> to us, for there it is that our Grievances are redreſſed; and <hi>Laws,</hi> that by proceſs of time are become <hi>uſeleſs</hi> or <hi>bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome,</hi> are repealed, and new and profitable <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Statutes</hi> are made: and, in a word, <hi>Barliaments</hi> to our Neighbours are their <hi>Burden,</hi> but our great <hi>Happineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> All manner of <hi>Taxes</hi> and <hi>Impoſitions</hi> are laid upon the People, at the Will and Pleaſure of the <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we can have no <hi>Tax</hi> impoſed upon us, but by our Conſent in <hi>Parliament;</hi> and there is this peculiar to us from the reſt of the World, That no <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> can be taxed for his <hi>Hand-labour,</hi> whereas in other Countries, and eſpecially <hi>France,</hi> every man pays for what he gets by his Labour: In <hi>France</hi> every Labourer pays two parts of three to the King; as, if he get Six pence in a day, Four pence is paid immediately to the King's Officer.</p>
            <pb n="648" facs="tcp:58538:231"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> In other Countries <hi>War</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> is made by the King, without conſulting the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and they are chargeable to that War, tho' made without their Conſent, or againſt their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
            <p>So it is with us, our King has the ſole power of making War and Peace, but the Sinews of War is in the <hi>People</hi> (I mean Money) and that they cannot part with, but with our own <hi>Conſent.</hi> And although the Matter of <hi>War</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> is an <hi>Arcanum Imperii,</hi> and that no man (as ſome ſay) may pry into it, ſave they to whom the King is pleaſed to communicate it: Yet I conceive, in this our Government, where the People are ſo eſſential a part of it, that they ought to be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the <hi>Ground</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> of the War, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they make themſelves chargeable to it: and the People are not bound to ſupport every War that the King may engage in; for methinks it's all the reaſon in the World that a Man ſhould be ſatisfied with the <hi>Cauſe</hi> before he part with his <hi>Money,</hi> and I think that Man is very unworthy of the Honour to ſerve his Country in Parliament, who ſhall give away the Peoples Money for any other thing, but what ſhall be effectually for the <hi>good</hi> and <hi>advantage</hi> of the <hi>People</hi> and <hi>Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>Eſtates</hi> and <hi>Goods</hi> are taken from the People without aſſigning a Reaſon of it, but only that it is the <hi>Mind</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> to have it ſo.</p>
            <p>But here no Man can be deprived of his <hi>Eſtate</hi> or <hi>Goods,</hi> but by due courſe of <hi>Law,</hi> for <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> is that the <hi>Law</hi> is very tender of. But although ſome ſay, That <hi>the King's Commiſſion may not be
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:58538:231"/>reſiſted in any caſe whatſoever,</hi> I ſhall not argue that point, becauſe this is not a proper time for it, and I hope we ſhall never have occaſion to try it; if it ever ſhould happen, I'll lay the Blame at the door of his Miniſters, for our King is a merciful Prince, and loves not ſuch things. Yet this, I am ſure, cannot be denied, That every Man's <hi>Houſe</hi> is his <hi>Caſtle,</hi> and may defend <hi>himſelf</hi> and his <hi>Goods</hi> againſt thoſe that ſhall <hi>aſſault</hi> or <hi>moleſt</hi> him; and I cannot believe that Man can be really a Friend either to his King or Country, but rather does it out of ſome ſiniſter end, or to curry Favour with the Court, that ſhall extol the King's Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative above the Laws, becauſe this Doctrine, if true, quite deſtroys the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of our <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;</hi> for if ever you ſet the King above Laws, then it muſt neceſſarily follow, that the King derives his <hi>Title</hi> to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> not from the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> but from ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe: but I am ſure that man does the King no great Service, who puts the King to ſeek his Title to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> any where elſe; than from the Laws of <hi>England.</hi> To ſet the King above all <hi>Law</hi> but that of his own Will, does ſo directly tax the Juſtice of <hi>God Almighty,</hi> that I cannot believe him to be a good Chriſtian that is of that Opinion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> In other Countries the <hi>Subjects</hi> are Impriſoned and Hanged at the <hi>Command</hi> of the King, without any other Reaſon given.</p>
            <p>But none of us can be deprived of <hi>Life, Limb,</hi> or <hi>Liberty,</hi> but for ſome Offence firſt committed againſt ſome known <hi>Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="650" facs="tcp:58538:232"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Our Neighbours are preſſed, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſerve in foreign Countries againſt their Wills, and are <hi>hanged</hi> for refuſing.</p>
            <p>Our King may preſs any of us for the defence of the <hi>Nation,</hi> but I never heard that the King could preſs any <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> to ſerve beyond the Seas.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> In other Countries, though the King or his Officers commit never ſo many or great <hi>Outrages</hi> and <hi>Cruelties</hi> upon the <hi>People,</hi> yet have the People no Remedy againſt either the King or his Officers.</p>
            <p>But with us, though our <hi>Law</hi> ſays, That <hi>the King can do no Wrong,</hi> yet his <hi>Officers</hi> and <hi>Miniſters</hi> may; and if any Man ſhall do an <hi>unlawful</hi> thing, though by the King's Command, that man is accountable to the People for it, and it is the Right of every <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> to call him to account; for if neither the King nor his Officers are anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for a breach of the Laws, then our <hi>Laws</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie nothing, and are but a <hi>dead Letter,</hi> and we no better than <hi>Slaves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Particulars I have now mentioned, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, may be ſufficient to convince any reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man of the Excellency of our Government. I ſhall not proceed further into Particulars, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe how and with what Caution all our <hi>Laws</hi> are made, and how <hi>Juſtice</hi> is adminiſtred in all Caſes, for I ſhould not only weary you, but want time to finiſh ſo great a Work; therefore I ſhall ſay this in part, That in no Government in the World the People live with ſuch <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi>
               <pb n="651" facs="tcp:58538:232"/>of what we enjoy, when the <hi>Laws</hi> are duly obſerved and followed, as we do; no Prince more ſafe and happy than ours, when he holds to the <hi>Laws,</hi> and it is the mutual Intereſt of both King and People to maintain the <hi>Laws.</hi> It is the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the People to ſupport the King in his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Prerogative, and it is the Intereſt of the King to preſerve the People in their due Rights and Liberties, for the <hi>Happineſs</hi> of one is bound up in the <hi>Welfare</hi> of the other. There is a certain bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance betwixt the King's Prerogative and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Properties, and he that endeavours to turn the Scales to either ſide, does in effect endeavour the deſtruction of both, for the Intereſt of the King and People are ſo interwoven, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſeparate or diſtinguiſh one from the other. In a word, our Government is both the Envy and Admiration of our Neighbours.</p>
            <p>But Gentlemen, notwithſtanding our excellent frame of Government, yet I find that many are impatient under it, and thirſt extreamly after that which is called a <hi>Common wealth,</hi> thinking (no doubt) to enjoy greater Priviledges and Immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties than now they do. But I am apt to believe, that they who are not contented under this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, have not conſider'd aright what a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth</hi> is. A <hi>Common-wealth</hi> makes a ſound and ſhadow of <hi>Liberty</hi> to the <hi>People,</hi> but in reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is but a <hi>Monarchy</hi> under another Name; for if <hi>Monarchy</hi> be <hi>Tyranny</hi> under a ſingle perſon, a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth</hi> is <hi>Tyranny</hi> under <hi>ſeveral perſons,</hi> as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Perſons that govern, ſo many Tyrants, but let it be the beſt that can be, yet the People under any Common-wealth enjoy not that Liberty that we do.</p>
            <pb n="652" facs="tcp:58538:233"/>
            <p>Gentlemen, as the Excellency of this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is an Argument ſufficient to diſſwade any of us from the leaſt attempt of alteration, ſo Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience has taught us, that no ſort of Government but that we now live under will ſuit or agree with <hi>England.</hi> Let us but conſider the late Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, how many ſeveral kinds of Government were there ſet up one after another? All ways were tryed, but nothing would do, till we were returned to our old and ancient way.</p>
            <p>But, Gentlemen, it may fall out, that we our ſelves may be the Authors of our own Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for whatever the Parliament does, we are bound up by it; if they paſs a <hi>Law</hi> to give away all we have to the King, we muſt ſubmit to it, for it is our own Act: and therefore it highly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves us to be very cautious who we chuſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent us in Parliament, we put all we have into their Hands, and what they do muſt bind and oblige us. Every Man is <hi>mortal,</hi> and poſſibly may be corrupted to <hi>vote</hi> againſt the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of them he repreſents; I accuſe none of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives, nor do I accuſe all, only tell you, that Men may be <hi>corrupted:</hi> Therefore, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, whenever you have occaſion to <hi>chuſe</hi> a <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> for the Parliament (as now you have) you ought to have a care of an <hi>ambitious</hi> Man, or a Man that is <hi>vain glorious,</hi> for it was never known that any of that Temper were ſo, out of a real intention to the <hi>Publick Good,</hi> for Ambition or Vain-glory was never accounted to be the Make of an Honeſt Man; and if you'll give me leave, I'll tell you what ſort of a Man I ſhall give my. Vote for: if I cannot have a Man that is both wiſe and honeſt, then I would rather be for an
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:58538:233"/>honeſt than wiſe man; for I would rather truſt all I have with a man that is truly honeſt, and leſs knowing, than with a man that is more knowing and leſs honeſt. I ſhall always be for a man that has a good Eſtate in the Country; for though he may poſſibly forget us, yet he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member himſelf, and avoid all unneceſſary charge upon the Country, becauſe he himſelf is to pay part of it. Next I am for a moderate man, one that is not ſtrict or rigid, neither one way nor the other, either in Church or State; for it's Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration that muſt keep every thing in right or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and it's Severity and Rigidneſs that will bring things into confuſion. In ſhort, Gentlemen, let your own Judgment, and not another Man's Intereſt or Inclination, direct you in this caſe, for our Parliament is our Weal or Woe. And now I will proceed to the Particulars of your Charge.</p>
            <p>The firſt and chief thing that you are to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, is,</p>

               </p>
               <p>Now, Gentlemen, you muſt obſerve, that the Heirs to the Crown are of two ſorts, firſt, <hi>Heir Apparent,</hi> that is the <hi>King's Eldeſt Son</hi> that is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, for no body elſe can be <hi>Heir Apparent;</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, their <hi>Expectant</hi> or <hi>Preſumptive,</hi> that is, he who in courſe of <hi>Deſcent</hi> is next in <hi>Blood</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> if he hath no <hi>Son.</hi> Now, the Offence is not ſo great to kill or procure the Death of the <hi>Heir

               <p>And now, Gentlemen, give me leave to take notice to you of them who very largely diſcourſe that the <hi>King</hi> is above the <hi>Laws;</hi> I am very apt to believe, that they don't conſider very well what they ſay, nor don't know or remember, that as it is High-Treaſon to kill or hurt the King, ſo it is High-Treaſon to ſubvert the Government, or to endeavour any alteration of it; and then I would ask any man to ſolve me this Queſtion, <hi>Whether or no it be not an alteration of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to render all our Laws ineffectual and uſeleſs, which muſt neceſſarily follow; and where it is, or upon what they ground their Opinion.</hi> I am ſure the Word of God warrants no ſuch thing; nor can any ſuch thing be found in the ancient Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Iſland, for at firſt it was govern'd without a King. I don't mention this as if I queſtion'd the King's Title to the Crown; no, Gentlemen, I would have every ſubject to pay him all poſſible Duty and Obedience, but I ſay this to ſhew you, that there is no Ground for that Opinion that the King is above the Laws. And I am ſure I never met with it either in <hi>Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> or any Law made ſince, and therefore I could wiſh they would forbear to preach up ſuch deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Doctrine both to King and People. I am ſure it is, for he that invades the Peoples Rights, does no leſs to the King: no man can perſwade the King to do a thing more contrary to him and his Intereſt, than to invade the Peoples Rights, for if one be hurt the other is hurt alſo; and he that
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:58538:235"/>will not do the King Right, cannot expect to have Right done to himſelf: No man can come to his Right but by doing the King Right, give each its due, but have a care how you give either ſide ſo much as an inch. And therefore I would that People would forbear to preach up ſuch deſtructive Doctrine both to King and People, and not put the King and Parliament to the Trouble to make a Law, whereby it ſhall be <hi>Treaſon</hi> in <hi>Words</hi> as well as <hi>Actions,</hi> to endeavour the leaſt alteration in the <hi>Government.</hi>

               <p>Gentlemen, you may obſerve, that many of the things I have mentioned are only done by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> whoſe Religion has been the Author of all our <hi>Troubles</hi> and <hi>Miſchiefs:</hi> it was the <hi>Papiſts</hi> who took off the late King's Head, though they made uſe of other People to act their part, yet they were the <hi>Contrivers</hi> of all: it was they who fired <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Southwark;</hi> and it's they who at this time would have brought us into the greateſt Confuſion that ever had been heard of, by a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign which nothing but Hell could be the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of, but God in his Mercy brought it to light juſt when it ſhould have been put in execution. It is with Horror when I conſider the Cruelty and Bloodſhed that muſt neceſſarily have enſued had this <hi>Plot</hi> gone on; it was no feigned thing, the matter is as clear as any thing can be, nothing but the execution of it could make it more clear; and yet I hear, that there are thoſe who will take upon them to ſay <hi>there is no Plot,</hi> and argue it; how far they are guilty themſelves, I know not, but I muſt tell them, that they render themſelves very ſuſpicious, to argue againſt that which every body believes and is ſatisfied of; for my part, I muſt judge them either to be in the <hi>Plot,</hi> or very much enclined to <hi>Popery:</hi> Wiſely therefore has the Law provided for us, againſt that from which there is ſo much danger. If <hi>Popery</hi> be the <hi>True Religion,</hi> God Almighty is not God Almighty, for certainly that Religion is very defective whoſe Foundation muſt be layed in <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Cruelty;</hi>
                  <pb n="658" facs="tcp:58538:236"/>and certainly God Almighty can propagate his Truth without having recourſe to ſuch unnatural means. I am ſure there is not to be found in Scripture the leaſt evidence or inſtance to warrant the <hi>killing of Men</hi> for their <hi>Religion;</hi> Men are to be convinced by <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Scripture,</hi> and not by <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Fire.</hi> The <hi>Papiſts</hi> think it a hard thing to be required to take the <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi> which Oaths don't deny them the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate uſe of their <hi>Religion,</hi> only require from them a Security to be true to the Government, but don't conſider, that their Church requires, <hi>that all muſt dye who will not change their Religion:</hi> or if any of them have an Eſtate held wrongfully from them, or is robbed or abuſed, they expect to have the benefit of the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they expect that the Government ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them, and they will not be bound to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it: how reaſonable this is, let any man judge. But, Gentlemen, there's no reaſon the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould defend them that would deſtroy it; though the <hi>Penalties</hi> are great, yet you ought to avoid Tenderneſs, becauſe ſo much depends upon it as does; and beſides, where any of them comes under a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> the Perſons themſelves don't ſuffer ſo much as the <hi>Common Stock,</hi> for they have <hi>Stocks</hi> and <hi>Banks</hi> for thoſe uſes, and to <hi>buy</hi> Poor People to their Religion. <hi>Popery</hi> is not a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but an Intereſt, which endeavours our deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therefore we ought to ſhew it no Favour. And this will ſuit very well with <hi>Moderation,</hi> for in all the <hi>Laws</hi> againſt the <hi>Papiſts</hi> the Penalties are very modeſt and moderate, in compariſon to what we have found at their hands, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:58538:236"/>to put the <hi>Laws</hi> ſtrongly in execution againſt them, cannot be called Severity.</p>
